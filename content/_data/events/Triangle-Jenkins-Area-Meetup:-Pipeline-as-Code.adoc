Session I: Jenkins at 30,000 feet with Eric Starr

Great for those just getting started with Jenkins, Eric will discuss what Jenkins is, Pipeline as Code, and talk about his most interesting engagement he's been on to date - being on the rescue team for healthcare.gov in November 2013.

Session II: Pipeline as Code demo with Eric Starr

In this session, Eric will recap Pipeline as Code before taking a deep dive into a demo. He will also be speaking on Global Pipeline Libraries and how to create one. Please feel free to bring your computers in order to work along with Eric's demo and ask questions. We will leave some time toward the end to have a "working session".

This team has created a library of reusable Groovy methods that enable internal development teams to rapidly build out their CI/CD pipelines. This is called Jenkins Pipeline as Code Global Pipeline Library or JPaC GPL.

Eric is on a never-ending journey of learning, applying and then teaching the best practices related to DevOps. There is no better way to learn something than to do it and then teach it.
