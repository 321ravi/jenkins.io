==== Jenkins no longer creates symbolic links inside project or build directories.

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37862[JENKINS-37862]

There were a lot of bugs and limitations with use of symbolink links for build directories, especially on platforms like Windows.
This functionality was not used widely, and starting from Jenkins LTS 2.190.1 Jenkins does not longer create symbolink links inside project or build directories.
The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-symlink[Build Symlink] plugin may be installed to restore this functionality if desired.
URLs such as `/job/â€¦/lastStableBuild/` are not affected, only tools which directly access the <code>$JENKINS_HOME</code> filesystem.
