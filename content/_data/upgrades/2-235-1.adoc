==== Auto refresh removed

The "Enable auto refresh" capability has been removed from Jenkins 2.235.1.
Auto refresh causes serious Jenkins performance issues if a user enables auto refresh on an expensive page and leaves their browser open on that page.
Auto refresh breaks form data entry by requiring that the form must be submitted before the next refresh or entered data will be lost.
Auto refresh breaks expandable list views.

Page refresh extensions are available for popular web browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Users that need automatic refresh of a Jenkins page should install one of those extensions.
