CI/CD Meetups and Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs) are local meetups intended to bring CI/CD users and contributors together for socializing and learning.
These are organized by local community members who have a passion for sharing new CI/CD concepts, patterns and tools.
We are also welcoming community members who are interested in other CI/CD projects such as Spinnaker, Tekton, and Jenkins X to join our network.

== How to find meetups?

See the current list of Jenkins & CI/CD meetup groups link:https://www.meetup.com/pro/cicd-cdf[here].
If there isn’t a CI/CD Meetup in your city, you could be the one to start it!

== JAMs program status

There has been a few updates to the Jenkins Area Meetups.
First, the Jenkins Area Meetup Pro account, which JAMs has been under,
has been rebranded after the transfer to Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).
We notified all meetup organizers about this transition in early October 2019. 

Meetup organizers are welcome to transition their meetup to CDF specific branding 
By no means JAMs are under any obligation to update the naming convention or the branding.
We are giving organizers the freedom to choose.
If you decide to change your meetup name we offer the following naming convention:
_Project Name City Name Meetup_ or _CI/CD City Name Meetup_.

== Organizing meetups

=== Getting Started

Whether you want to start a JAM or a CI/CD meetup, send us an email meetups@cd.foundation to get started.
Let us know the city in which you’d like to host the CI/CD Meetup.
Our team will create a meetup page on meetup.com and we will work with you to organize your meetup.

See the application guidelines link:https://github.com/cdfoundation/meetups#how-to-apply[here]! 

=== CI/CD and JAM Support

CI/CD and Jenkins Meetups receive support from the Continuous Delivery Foundation via swag (stickers, etc), promotion, and help bootstrapping and operating the meetup group.

* Swag - We will send you cool swags (stickers, t-shirts, etc) to share with members
* Promote - We give every CDF Meetup and JAM social media love via Twitter, blog posts, Facebook, newsletter, and post on the link:https://cd.foundation/events/list/[events calendar].
* CI/CD Expertise - We will help you to schedule a project expert as the key speaker at your meetup, or provide you with presentation materials.
* Outreach - We will assist in reaching out to your local community for food/venue sponsorship.
* Support specific to JAMs - As CDF will manage the operational aspect of JAMs and CI/CD meetups, the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/[Advocacy & Outreach SIG] is a channel to provide guidance/advice to new JAM organizers if needed. See the contacts on the linked page.

=== Best Practices

* Attend existing meetup groups to gauge any of CDF's current projects interest/market within your area.
* Reach out to existing CDF/JAM organizer(s) to learn best practices and time commitment.
* Set up a Twitter account (for example, #JenkinsNYC). Email your group’s Twitter ID to meetups@cd.foundation so we can help to promote your meetup.
* Promote, tweet and post your meetup in advance.
* Avoid product pitches. Keep it real, it’s not about promotions. This is about - and for - learning opportunities for the community.
* Shake up the format. Have presentations, panel discussions, roundtables, workshops, hackathons, etc.
* Set a consistent date, time and location so members will plan for it. Avoid cancelling your meeting as people will lose faith and stop RSVPing for your meetup.
* Review the CDF meetups repository on Github https://github.com/cdfoundation/meetups

=== Stepping Down

In the event you can no longer be an organizer, we ask that you nominate a
replacement organizer in your place. If this is not possible please send email
to meetups@cd.foundation and/or contact the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/[Advocacy & Outreach SIG], we will work with you to find a replacement.
