link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes. 

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project. 
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.
