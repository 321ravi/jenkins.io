link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== GSoC 2019

=== Office hours

There is a weekly GSoC SIG project meeting,
which happens at 2PM UTC on Wednesdays.
The meetings are usually recorded,
and we post links in link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[our gitter channel]
before the meeting starts.
You can find recording of office hours link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG[here].

Although we use mailing lists as the main communication channel,
we also define regular timeslots aka "office hours".
During these timeslots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors will be also available
in the Gitter channel.
Video calls will be conducted on-demand.

In addition to these meetings,
each GSoC project has regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
See the project pages for the schedule.
