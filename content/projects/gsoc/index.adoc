link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== GSoC 2019

In 2019 we plan to apply to Google Summer of Code.
Currently we are looking for project ideas and mentors
(link:/blog/2018/12/26/gsoc-2019-call-for-mentors/[announcement]).
All Jenkins contributors are welcome to participate.
We already have a significant number of project ideas,
they are listed link:/projects/gsoc/2019/project-ideas[here].

If you are a student, you are welcome to explore existing project ideas towards the GSoC application phase.
There are ways to reach out to mentors,
and many projects have lists of newbie-friendly issues you can start from.
Students are also welcome to propose their own project ideas.

== Contacts

We use the link:/sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] for communications about GSoC.
Projects may also have their own mailing lists, chats and meetings.
See details on project pages.

=== Mailing lists

Public Google Group: link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public[jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public].

The purpose of this mailing list is for all public communications on GSoC such as new mentor and new student introductions,
project proposal questions and discussions, process and timeline related questions. For private matters such as communication
difficulties with mentors, students, or org admins, please use the admin mailing list shown link:#orgadmin[below].

=== Chats

** link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC Gitter channel] for organizational topics
** link:/chat/[Common developer chats] for technical topics.

=== Office hours

Although we use mailing lists as the main communication channel,
we also have regular "office hours" video calls.
During these timeslots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors are available for any GSoC-related questions.

Before the announcement of accepted projects,
we will be using a weekly link:sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] meeting as the office hours slot (2PM UTC on Wednesdays).
More slots may be added in the future.
We post links in link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[our Gitter channel]
before the meeting starts.
Meetings are recorded on-demand and posted link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG[here].

In addition to these organization-wide meetings,
each GSoC project has regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
See the project pages for the schedule.
