goal: "* Fingerprints are stored in external system so that they do not go to the local storage JENKINS_HOME It includes storage of extensible data structures supported in the current Jenkins architecture * Fingerprints can be stored in a single database for multiple Jenkins instances (and other systems) so that it allows tracing artifacts within the entire CI/CD flow * There are new APIs to query data from external storages in efficient ways. New REST API or GraphQL endpoints can be introduced in the Jenkins core or in a plugin"
