EDA Tools generate various types of reports, and a lot of these reports can be treated as
coverage reports. Simulation tools provide code coverage, assertion coverage and functional coverage.
Synthesis tools provide resource utilization levels for LUTs, PLLs, and other internal resources,
which can also be visualized as resource coverage levels (3 out of 4 PLLs used).

Open-source EDA tools would be preferable (e.g. Yosys, FuseSoC, ArachnePnR, icetools), but we also consider
conditionally-free tools (like ASIC/FPGA EDAs).

This is a proposal to build EDA coverage adapters based on the new Jenkins
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/code-coverage-api-plugin[coverage api],
for open source tools such as Yosys, ArachnePnR, icetools, etc., 
or for conditionally-free tools (like ASIC/FPGA EDAs).

**Special requirements:**
Access to EDA tools, open source or commercial.
