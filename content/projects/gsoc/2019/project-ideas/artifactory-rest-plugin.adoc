This new plugin would wrap the link:https://github.com/cdancy/artifactory-rest[artifactory-rest]
library, allowing Pipeline scripts to interact easily with Artifactory
instances via the Artifactory REST API. This plugin would eliminate the
need to parse HTTP responses, and it would make pipeline scripts more concise.

It would be interesting to generate this plugin automatically simply
by reading the link:https://github.com/cdancy/artifactory-rest[artifactory-rest] library.
This would enable automatic updates to this project each time the underlying library is updated,
and it would also enable the automatic maintenance.

Similar ideas are being proposed for similar libraries (
link:/projects/gsoc2019/project-ideas/bitbucket-rest-plugin[bitbucket-rest plugin], 
link:/projects/gsoc2019/project-ideas/jenkins-rest-plugin[jenkins-rest plugin]), and
it would be efficient to have a common approach to all three plugins.
