This page aggregates project ideas for Google Summer of Code 2019.
See more information about this project and applications at link:/projects/gsoc/[the project's page].

Below you can find project ideas proposed by potential mentors.
Other ideas may be proposed by students (e.g. new features in the core, "write a plugin for MY_TOOL_OR_SERVICE", etc.).
Such project applications will be considered though applicants may need to work
with the community and GSoC admins to find potential mentors.

== Cloud Features for External Workspace Manager Plugin

We wish to add Cloud features to the Jenkins External Workspace Manager Plugin.

This would allow Jenkins workspaces to be cloud based or located remotely, rather than being local.
These features include:

* Cloud-based storage support (link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/z40kn8IqFb8/YkdgbuScCgAJ[discussion])
* Support use of multiple discard strategies
* Integration with the core's “Discard old builds” feature
* Improvements to data retention policies (e.g.
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-48715[JENKINS-48715],
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-2111[JENKINS-2111],
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38764[JENKINS-38764])
* Workspace usage statistics
* Improvements to workspace usage statistics
* Better workspace cleanup management, e.g. matrix workspaces cleanup link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-27329[JENKINS-27329]

**SIGs:**
link:/sigs/cloud-native

**Skills:**
Java, Cloud-based storage

== Role Strategy Plugin performance and/or user experience

link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Role+Strategy+Plugin[Role Strategy Plugin] is widely used in Jenkins as an authorization engine,
but it has known performance limitations for large-scale setups.
In this project the proposal is to improve the plugin's performance and to create a proper testing framework for Jenkins security plugins.
Web interfaces of this plugin can be also improved.

**Skills:**
Java, performance testing, profiling tools, JavaScript (for UX part)

== Plugin(s) for Electronic Design Automation tools

The idea is to create a Jenkins plugin for one of widely used EDA tools.
Both ASIC or FPGA design flow are acceptable, the tool should be proposed by the potential student.
Open-source EDA tools would be preferable (e.g. Yosys, FuseSoC, ArachnePnR, icetools), but we also consider
conditionally-free tools (like FPGA design EDAs).


Examples of tool integration:

* Tool launch and publishing steps for Free-style and/or Pipeline jobs
* Integration with Warnings Plugin for report parsing.
* Reporting of FPGA resource utilization (per build + trends)
* Timing report trend publishing
* Integrating UVM reports into Jenkins build and project pages

**Skills:**
Jenkins as a user, Java

**Special requirements:**
In the case of FPGA tools integration, a prototyping board will be required.

== Improvements to the Jenkins Acceptance Test Harness

The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness[Jenkins Acceptance Test Harness (ATH)] is a great vehicle
to test Jenkinsfiles and custom DSL libraries ahead of deploying them to production servers.
However, it has couple of drawbacks.

* it can be quite slow as it needs to bootstrap an entire Jenkins instance for each test method.
* real production environments typically need to use a very specific plugin list of pre-defined plugins and plugin versions

Improving these two areas would make the ATH more efficient and easy to use for Jenkinsfile and custom DSL library testing.

For example, instead of dynamically creating a Jenkins instance for each test, an instance could be built as a docker image,
loaded as a java link:https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java[testcontainers], and injected with the DSL to be tested.

**Skills:**
Java, Selenium, Docker

== Discard Builds Step Plugin

The idea behind this plugin is to give users more options to manage and implement a data retention policy that covers their build histories, artifacts
and workspaces (internal and external).
This responsibility typically falls on the shoulders of Jenkins administrators,
but since projects can have unique data retention requirements, this responsibility should be with project contributors.
This plugin would enable users to specify their own data retention policy via a Pipeline build step.

The current Discard Old Builds feature could be improved, however to use it one must resort to clicking buttons in the UI, which is not
desirable in the context of configuration-as-code. Also, the plugin would offer features above and beyond the existing Discard Old Builds functionality.

The plugin would internally work in two phases:

* Determine a list of builds to discard by looking at the build history of a given project.
* Perform the discard actions on the builds that were made elements of the list of builds to discard.

This plugin would leverage and enhance the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Run Selector Plugin] for selecting builds to discard, and new code would be written to perform the data discard actions.

More information regarding this proposal is available link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2p_XZEdbkcVDMpEPTtjPS15i2Oq3CQgH_geJjPhofY/edit#heading=h.h6ynt8ul8vwx[here].

**Skills:**
