---

The popular promoted-builds-plugin in Jenkins currently supports Freestyle/Abstract Projects but however is incompatible with the
Pipeline structure. The existing plugin was developed before the introduction of pipelines which makes the current design archaic enough
to not support the pipeline builds. Thus, this project aims at reviving Promotion into the pipelines by introducing a new plugin which
includes major updates and redesigns done on a copy of the existing plugin(promoted-builds).
The end result here would be a robust plugin which can run an on-demand promotion when the pipeline build is completed along
with other artifact tracking and job triggering functions.


Sub-tasks to complete the project:


. Refactor the promoted-builds-plugin to make it pipeline compatible.
. Avail from the Run-Selector/copyArtifacts module to copy/select the upstream/downstream build.
. Use fingerprinting to detect the triggered downstream job.(Other applications of fingerprinting yet to be discussed)
. Update the Jenkins release plugin(to share the common APIs)
. [Add more sub-tasks after discussion with the mentors during Community Bonding]
