Current versions of Jenkins Remoting are based on the TCP protocol.
If it fails, the agent connection and the build fails as well.
There are also issues with traffic prioritization and multi-agent communications,
which impact Jenkins stability and scalability.

This project aims an update of Remoting and Jenkins in order to add support of
a popular message queue/bus technology (RabbitMQ or Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins.
