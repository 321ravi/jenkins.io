There are a lot of plugins which currently implement code coverage (clover plugin, cobertura plugin, clover php plugin, etc),
however they all are using similar charts and similar content.
Instead of having one plugin for each code coverage result it would be best if we could merge them all into one plugin which will handle code coverage.
