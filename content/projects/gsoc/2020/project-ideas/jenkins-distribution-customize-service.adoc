For many users, they download Jenkins first, then select some plugins and configure them. 
It might take a lot of time, like hours. But if we can get a perfect Jenkins distribution which contains all we need, 
it can save that time for us.

The service could be in the form of a website offered as https://customize.jenkins.io.
Plus, it should support self-hosting by Jenkins users who want to run it internally. 
People can select the following configuration items:

* Jenkins core version
* plugins
* common configuration, user/password, update-center site e.g.
* plugin based configuration, Kubernetes, Sonarqube plugin config e.g.
* multi-form package, jenkins.war or docker image
* other things

Two projects are expected backend and frontend. Thanks to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager[Custom Jenkins WAR packager for Jenkins], 
it already did a lot of works. It can be the main library for the backend project. 

The backend should provide the modern Restful API. We can develop different clients based on that ie: UI or CLI. A readable API document is
necessary. Like many projects, the Swagger UI is a good example.
We can start the backend project with SpringBoot, it might save a lot of time.
