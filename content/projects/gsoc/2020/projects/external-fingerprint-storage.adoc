=== Abstract

File fingerprinting is a way to track which version of a file is being used by a job/build, making dependency tracking
easy.
The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc. within the system.
It does this by maintaining a local XML-based database.
This leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins master.

The core idea of this project was to extend Jenkins core to support storing of fingerprints in external storages.
External storage plugins can then be used to configure connection to the storage, and fingerprint handling happens
in a seamless way.
The project led to the creation of two plugins, backed by Redis and PostgreSQL.

=== The External Fingerprint Storage API

This section explains the external fingerprint storage API that was created in Jenkins core.
For further details, please refer to jep:226[] which explains the design decisions in detail.

We created the `FingerprintStorage` class which defines the API for allowing building of custom storage engines.
We exposed the following methods in the API for plugin developers:

* `void save()`

** Saves the given Fingerprint in the storage.

* `Fingerprint load(String id)`

** Returns the Fingerprint with the given unique ID. The unique ID for a fingerprint is defined by
Fingerprint#getHashString().

* `void delete(String id)`

** Deletes the Fingerprint with the given unique ID.

* `boolean isReady()`

** Returns true if there is some data in the fingerprint database corresponding to the particular Jenkins instance.

For more details, please refer to the Javadoc for link:[] and link:[].

==== Fingerprint Cleanup

Fingerprint cleanup thread works by periodically iterating over the fingerprints and editing the job and build
information of the ones based on whether they are still present in the system.
It also deletes the fingerprints which do not have any build or job associated with them.

We extend this fingerprint cleanup functionality to be supported by external storages.
FingerprintStorage API was extended with the following methods:

* `iterateAndCleanupFingerprints(TaskListener taskListener)`

** Plugins can implement this method (which is called by Jenkins core periodically) to iterate and cleanup the
fingerprints.
The reason to design it this way, and not to iterate all the fingerprints via core, is because external storages
may be able to implement more efficient traversal strategies on their own.

* `boolean cleanFingerprint(Fingerprint fingerprint, TaskListener taskListener)`

** This provides a reference implementation of cleanup, which external storages can use to cleanup a fingerprint.
They may use this, or extend it to provide custom implementations.

Finally, we introduce the option to turn off fingerprint cleanup. This is done because it may be the case that storing extra data may be cheaper than performing cleanups, especially with external storages.

==== Fingerprint Migration

We implemented a lazy migration strategy to transfer the fingerprints from local storage to the newly
configured external storage.
Once an external fingerprint storage is configured, the new fingerprints are stored directly in the new storage
engine.
However, the old fingerprints present on the disk storage are migrated as and when they are used.

This allows the fingerprints to be migrated gradually from the local storage to the external storage and
prevent huge migrations in one go.
One caveat is that in case the fingerprint cleanup is turned on, the fingerprints will get transferred whenever
cleanup is triggered.
