This page list the current community programs, and the programs we're interested in.

== Current Programs

The Jenkins community participates in the following programs:

=== Google Summer of Code

link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

For more information, see link:/projects/gsoc/[our GSoC project page].

The https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/[Google Season of Doc]
program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

The Jenkins organization would like to participate in this program, but we have not yet been accepted.

Please see the
link:/sigs/docs[documentation SIG] page
for contact information, and let us know if you'd like to help us participate in this program.
