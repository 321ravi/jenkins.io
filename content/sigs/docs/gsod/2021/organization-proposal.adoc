== About your organization

Jenkins, originally founded in 2006 as "Hudson", is one of the leading automation servers.
The project's motto is "Build great things at any scale".
Using extensible, plugin-based architecture developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads.
Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components.

The project has thousands of active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, and, of course, documentation.
We invite technical writers to join the community and contribute to the documentation being used by millions of Jenkins users worldwide.

== About your project

We need to expand the documentation describing Jenkins on Kubernetes.
We would like to create documentation that describes the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.

The improved documentation will also be referenced in a Kubernetes Solutions Page.
