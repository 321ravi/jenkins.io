This article describes our observations during Windows testing of the Jenkins 2.249.1 release candidate.

== Upgrade testing

Jenkins 2.249.1 is a new long term support release with user interface improvements and changes in Windows support.
It is the first long term support release to drop support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0.
The end of support for Microsoft.NET framework 2.0 was announced in the link:/blog/2020/07/23/windows-support-updates/[Windows Support Updates blog post].
The Windows support link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/23/windows-support-updates/#upgrade-guidelines[upgrade guidelines] describe major things to consider when upgrading Jenkins controllers and agents on Windows.

As part of our preparation for the release, we tested several configurations.
This article describes our experiences with those configurations

=== Upgrade approaches

We tested controller and agent upgrades from Jenkins 2.235.X to 2.249.1-rc on Windows.
The tests included:

* <<32 bit Windows MSI>>
* <<64 bit Windows MSI>>
* <<WAR (file) on Windows>>

=== Upgrade process

Our upgrade process included:

* Install a previous version of Jenkins controller on Windows
* Install a previous version of Jenkins agent on Windows and configure it as a service
* Upgrade Jenkins controller from "Manage Jenkins"
* Restart the Jenkins Windows service for the controller
* Upgrade the Jenkins agent on Windows with the latest `agent.jar`
* Restart the Jenkins Windows service for the agent

=== Testing reults

We successfully tested

* Restarting Windows service for controller (link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-63198[JENKINS-63198])
* Restarting Windows service for agents (link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-63223[JENKINS-63223])

We confirmed that we can continue our link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/07/23/windows-support-updates/#new-policy[Level 1 support policy] for Jenkins 2.249.1.

== 32 bit Windows MSI

Prior to Jenkins 2.235.3, the Jenkins LTS Windows installer was provided as a 32 bit MSI and included a bundled Java 8 runtime environment.

== 64 bit Windows MSI

Beginning with link:/blog/2020/08/12/windows-installers-upgrade/[Jenkins 2.235.3], the Jenkins LTS Windows installer is a 64 bit MSI.
It requires the user has previously installed a 64 bit JDK and will use that JDK to run Jenkins.

== WAR (file) on Windows

Jenkins allows users to run the Jenkins web archive (WAR) file from a command line and then install it as a service from within Jenkins.
