Another great coding phase for link:https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/github-checks/[GitHub Checks API Project] ends!
In this phase, we focused on consuming the checks API in two widely used plugin:

* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/[Warnings NG Plugin] 
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api/[Code Coverage API Plugin]

Besides the external usage, we have also split the general checks API from its GitHub implementation and released both of them:

* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/checks-api/[Checks API Plugin]
* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-checks/[GitHub Checks Plugin]

.Coding Phase 2 Demo [starts from 25:20]

== Warning Checks

The newly released https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/releases/tag/warnings-ng-8.4.0[Warnings NG plugin 8.4.0] will use checks API to publish different check runs for different static analysis tools.
Without leaving GitHub, users are now able to see the analysis report they interested in.

On GitHub's conversation tab for each PR, users will see summaries for those checks like the screenshot above. The summaries will include:

* The status that indicates the quality gate
* The name of the analysis tool used
* A short message that indicates statistics of new and total issues

More fine-grained statistics can be found in the `Details` page.

Another practical feature is the annotation for specific lines of code. Users can now review the code alone with the annotations.

=== Try It

In https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/releases/tag/warnings-ng-8.4.0[Wanings NG plugin 8.4.0], the warning checks is set as a default feature. 
Therefore, you can get those checks for your own GitHub project just in a few steps:

1. Update Warnings NG plugin to 8.4.0
2. Install link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/checks-api/[Checks API plugin] and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-checks/[GitHub Checks plugin] on your Jenkins instance
3. Configure warnings-ng plugin as usual for a multi-branch project or a GitHub organization project

=== Pipeline Usage:

Pipeline users can control this feature through a boolean field `skipPublishingChecks`, e.g.

```
recordIssues tool: errorProne(), healthy: 1, unhealthy: 20, skipPublishingChecks: false
```

== Coverage Checks

The coverage checks are achieved by consuming the API in link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api/[Code Coverage API plugin].
First, in the conversation tab of a PR, users will be able to see the summary about the coverage and the comparing with previous builds.

Besides, the `Details` page will contain some other things:

* The links to the reference build, including the target branch build from the master branch and the last successful build from this branch
* Coverage healthy score (the default value is 100% if the threshold is not configured)
* Coverages and trends of different types in table format

The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/code-coverage-api-plugin/pull/169[pull request] for this feature will soon be merged and will be included in the next release of Coverage Checks API plugin.

== Next Phase

In the next phase, we will turn our attention back to link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/checks-api/[Checks API Plugin] and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-checks/[GitHub Checks Plugin]. 
Pipeline support will be added: users can publish checks directly in a pipeline script without requiring a consumer plugin that supports the checks.
Re-run request for Jenkins build through Checks API will be added as well. 
Hopefully, we will also release the first official version for both plugins.
