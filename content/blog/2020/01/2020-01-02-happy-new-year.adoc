## Project updates

Highlights above do not cover all advancements we had in the project.
Below you can find slides from the link:https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/264795368/[Jenkins contributor summit] in Lisbon.

## Some stats

**Jenkins core**.
In 2019 Jenkins core had **54** weekly and **13** LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.
There was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.
We also finally got support of user timezones, not speaking of emojis support ðŸ¥³.
There was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.
The core's components also got major updates.
Only link:/projects/remoting/[Jenkins Remoting] got **11** releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins masters.
There are also major incoming changes like jep:222[WebSocket Services] support. 

**Plugins**.
There were **2605** plugin releases, and **157** NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.
In particular Jenkins ecosystem has got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.
Also, warm welcome back to the plugin:scriptler[Scriptler Plugin] which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.
If you are afraid about such plugin number, there is a new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool] which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.

**Security**.
It was a hot year for the link:/security/[Jenkins Security Team].
There were **5** link:/security/advisories/[security advisories] for the core and *20* - for plugins.
In total we disclosed **288** security vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.
plugin:script-security[Script Security Plugin] was the hottest plugin with **10** critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.
Plain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type **120** disclosures in 2019.
It was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted y contributors after code surveys,
special thanks link:https://github.com/woodspeed[Viktor Gazdag] who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story link:/2019/11/29/do-plugins-store-credentials-in-a-secure-way/[here]).

**Infrastructure**.
Got Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.
All these and many other servies are maintained by the link:/projects/infrastructure/[Jenkins Infrastructure Team].
This year the team handled **more than 400** requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.

**Configuration as Code** was one of the most popular areas this year.
plugin:configuration-as-code[Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin] had more than **30** releases with new features and bug fixes.
More than **50** plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.
As a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from **2000** to almost **8000** installations),
and now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.
This year we also ran out very first link:https://communitybridge.org/[CommunityBridge] project devoted to link:/projects/jcasc/dev-tools/[JCasC Schema validation and developer tools].

So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features!

## What's next?

Year 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.
There are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.
As it was written link:/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/#whats-next-for-the-board[Board elections blogpost],
there are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.
In the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists] and link:/sigs/[special interest groups],
and we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.

Next month we will participate in link:https://fosdem.org/2020/[FOSDEM], and there will be a Jenkins stand there.
On January 31st we will also host a traditional contributor summit in Brussels,
where we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.
If you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!
See link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/PUgV5xxHMwgp[this thread] for more information.

We also plan to continue all outreach programs.
At the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas (link:/blog/2019/12/20/call-for-mentors/[announcement]),
and we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.
We also work on improving link:/participate/[contribution guidelines] for newcomers and expert contributors.
If you are interested, please contact the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/[Advocacy and Outreach SIG].


If you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join the contributor summits/hackathons.
We also want to participate in Google Summer of Code 2020,
and currently we are link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/We-14-z_YXU[looking for mentors].

Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.
We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.
Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.
