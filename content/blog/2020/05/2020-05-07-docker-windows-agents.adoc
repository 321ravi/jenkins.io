We would like to announce the availability of Windows agent images for Docker.

== New images

* link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/agent[jenkins/agent] is a basic agent which bundles the agent.jar for agent <= => master communication. This is most useful as a base image for other images.

* link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/inbound-agent[jenkins/inbound-agent] is an agent that is based on the jenkins/agent image above. It provides a wrapper script written in PowerShell to help specify the parameters to agent.jar.

* link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/ssh-agent[jenkins/ssh-agent] is an image which has OpenSSH installed and should be used with the link:plugins.jenkins.io/ssh-slaves/[SSH Build Agents Plugin].

== Deeper Dive




== Upgrading and Compatibility Notes

Good news, there are no breaking changes caused by this renaming.
All images have been already modified to use the new terminology internally.
If you use the recent versions of the previous images,
you can just replace the old names with the new ones.
These names may be referenced in your Dockerfiles, scripts, and Jenkins configurations.

We will keep updating the old images on DockerHub for at least 3 months (until August 05, 2020).
There will be no new configurations and platforms added to the old images,
but all existing ones will remain available (Debian for Java 1.8 and 11, Alpine for Java 1.8, etc.).
After August 05, 2020, the old images will no longer receive updates, but previous versions will remain available to users on Dockerhub.

== What's next?

We will continue renaming of the Docker images in Jenkins components which reference old image names.
There is also a set of link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jnlp-agents[convenience Docker images] which include build tools like Maven or Gradle which will be renamed later.
The `jenkins/ssh-agent` image might be renamed again in the future as well;
see the ongoing discussion in this developer link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/oxD-Hd_7l9k/WAbvqD-wEQAJ[mailing list thread].

If you are rather interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,
stay tuned for future announcements!
There are multiple ongoing initiatives which you can find on the link:/project/roadmap/[public Jenkins roadmap]
(in the draft stage, see jep:14[]).
Some stories:

- General availability of Windows images.
- Support for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC).
- Switching to AdoptOpenJDK.
- Introducing multi-platform Docker images.

If you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,
please reach out to the link:/sigs/platform[Platform Special Interest Group] which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in Docker.

Regarding the agent terminology cleanup outside Docker images,
we will keep working on this project in the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach[Advocacy & Outreach SIG].
If you see the usage of the obsolete "slave" term anywhere in the Jenkins organization (Web UI, documentation, etc.),
please feel free to submit a pull request or to report an issue in the jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC.
There are "just" link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+slave&type=Code[3000 occurences] left in the `jenkinsci` GitHub organization, but we will get there.
Any contributions will be appreciated!
