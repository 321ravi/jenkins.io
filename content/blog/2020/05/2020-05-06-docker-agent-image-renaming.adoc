We would like to announce the renaming of the official Docker images for Jenkins agents.
This article provides information about the new official names, upgrade procedure, and the support policy for the old images.
This renaming does not have any immediate impact on Jenkins users.

== New image names

* link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/agent[jenkins/agent] is the new name of the old link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/slave[jenkins/slave] image,
  starting from link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/releases/tag/4.3-2[4.3-2]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/inbound-agent[jenkins/inbound-agent] is the new name of the  link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/jnlp-slave[jenkins/jnlp-slave] image,
  starting from link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/releases/tag/4.3-2[4.3-2]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/agent[jenkins/agent] is the new name of the old link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/ssh-slave[jenkins/ssh-slave] image,
  starting from link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-agent/releases/tag/2.0.0[2.0.0]

See the upgrade guidelines below.

== Why?

The "slave" term is widely considered inappropriate in open source communities.
It has been officially deprecated in Jenkins 2.0 in 2016, but there are remaining usages in some Jenkins components.
The jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC tracks cleanup of such usages.
Official Docker agent images were a glaring case, it was not easy to fix that with the previous versions of the image release Pipelines on DockerHub.
It is great to have the image naming issue finally fixed by this update.

Another notable change is replacing the _JNLP agent_ term with _inbound agent_.
Historically "JNLP" has been used as a name of link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/protocols.md[Remoting protocols].
JNLP stands for link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start#Java_Network_Launching_Protocol_(JNLP)[Java Network Launch Protocol] which is a part of the Java Web Start.
Jenkins supports Java Web Start mode for agents when running agents on Java 1.8,
but our networking protocols are based on TCP and have nothing to do with Java Network Launch Protocol.
This name has been very confusing since the beginning 
and became worse with the introduction of WebSocket support in Jenkins 2.217 (jep:222[]).
Docker agent images support WebSockets, so we decided to change the image name to link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jenkins/inbound-agent[jenkins/inbound-agent] so that it prevents further confusion.

== Upgrading and Compatibility Notes

Good news, there are no breaking changes caused by this renaming.
All images have been already modified to use the new terminology internally.
If you use the recent versions of the previous images,
you can just replace the old names with the new ones.
These names may be referenced in your Dockerfiles, scripts, and Jenkins configurations.

We will keep updating the old images on DockerHub for at least 3 months (until August 05, 2020).
There will be no new configurations and platforms added to the old images,
but all existing ones will remain available (Debian for Java 1.8 and 11, Alpine for Java 1.8, etc.).
After August 05, 2020, the old images will no longer receive updates, but previous versions will remain available to users on Dockerhub.

== What's next?

We will continue renaming of the Docker images in Jenkins components which reference old image names.
There is also a set of link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jnlp-agents[convenience Docker images] which include build tools like Maven or Gradle which will be renamed later.
The `jenkins/ssh-agent` image might be renamed again in the future as well;
see the ongoing discussion in this developer link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/oxD-Hd_7l9k/WAbvqD-wEQAJ[mailing list thread].

If you are interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,
stay tuned for future announcements!
There are multiple ongoing initiatives:
  general availability of Windows images,
  adding support for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC),
  switching to AdoptOpenJDK,
  and other stories.
You can find some of these stories on the link:/project/roadmap/[public Jenkins roadmap] which is currently in the draft stage (see jep:14[]).
If you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,
please reach out to the link:/sigs/platform[Platform Special Interest Group] which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in Docker.

Regarding the agent terminology cleanup outside Docker images,
we will keep working on this project in the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach[Advocacy & Outreach SIG].
If you see the usage of the obsolete "slave" term anywhere in the Jenkins organization (Web UI, documentation, etc.),
please feel free to submit a pull request or to report an issue in the jira:JENKINS-42816[Slave to Agent renaming leftovers] EPIC.
There are "just" link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+slave&type=Code[3000 occurences] left in the `jenkinsci` GitHub organization, but we will get there.
Any contributions will be appreciated!
