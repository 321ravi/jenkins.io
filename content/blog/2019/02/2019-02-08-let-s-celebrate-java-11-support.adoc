We have worked hard for this and it's now here.
We are thrilled to announce **full support for Java 11 in Jenkins** starting from Jenkins 2.164 and LTS 2.164.1.
This means you can now run your instance with a Java 11 JVM.

Starting in June 2018, many events were organized to improve Jenkins code base and add Java 11 support.
Beyond these events, Core/Plugins maintainers and many other contributors have worked hard to make sure they discover and solve as many issues as possible related to Java 11 support.

The effort to support Java 11 led to the creation of the https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/211/README.adoc[JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins].
It also spurred the creation of the https://jenkins.io/sigs/platform[Platform Special Interest Group] to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.

== Celebration

We'd like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and attendees and all those in the community who have generously lent their time and support to this effort.
Thank you all!

== Guidelines

Running Jenkins on Java 11 with Docker is simple.
You can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with `-jdk11`.

So you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:

[source, shell]
----
docker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11
----

More detailed documentation can be found at link:/doc/administration/requirements/jenkins-on-java-11#discovering-issues-with-java-11[Running Jenkins on Java 11].

== What's next

Even though this is a big achievement, we still have work to do.

Our first priority is adding Java 11 support to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner[JenkinsFile Runner] project.
From there, we will move on to port Java 11 support to the link:https://github.com/jenkins-x[Jenkins X] project and the link:projects/evergreen/[Evergreen] project.

So, even if this is a big deal to us, this is not the end of the story.
It is a major step that will benefit users, developers, and members of the Jenkins community.
