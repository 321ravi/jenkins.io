We have worked hard for this and it's now here.
We are happy to announce the **full support of Jenkins over Java 11**.
This means you can now run your instance on with a Java 11 JVM.

Since June 2018, many events were organized to improve the code base of Jenkins to support running on Java 11.
Outside of those events, Core and Plugins maintainers have worked hard to make sure to discover and solve issues related to Java 11.

The effort to support Java 11 lead to the creation of the https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/211/README.adoc[JEP-211: Java 10+ support in Jenkins].
It also formed the https://jenkins.io/sigs/platform[Platform Special Interest Group] to coordinate the Java 11 work and other platform support efforts.

== Celebration

We'd like to take a moment to thank everyone involved in this tasks: code contributors, issue reporters, testers, event planners and everyone in the community who has been involved in this.
Thank you all!

== Guidelines

Running Jenkins on Java 11 with Docker is simple.
You can select a Java 11 based image by suffixing the tag of the image with `-jdk11`.

So you can run Jenkins on Java 11 with:

[source, shell]
----
docker run -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins:2.164-jdk11
----

You can find more details on the specific documentation page: /doc/administration/requirements/jenkins-on-java-11#discovering-issues-with-java-11[Running Jenkins on Java 11].

== What's next

We still have work to do.
We are working on the support of Java 11 on the https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner[JenkinsFile Runner] project.
From there, we will port the support to https://github.com/jenkins-x[Jenkins X] project.
