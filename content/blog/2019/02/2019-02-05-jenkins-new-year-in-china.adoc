At the time of the Spring Festival. I want to make a summary of some activities in the last year. 
You might already notice that more and more Chinese contributors emerge in the Jenkins community. 
We have a GSoC champion who is link:https://github.com/cizezsy[Shenyu Zheng]. 
He is a great example for other students. With the effort of three skilled engineers, 
many Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases. 
They co-orgnaized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.

Thank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.

Chinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker. 
So letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of link:https://jenkins.io/sigs/chinese-localization/[Chinese Localization SIG]. 
You can find three participants on the page. But that's not the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/cn.jenkins.io/graphs/contributors[full list]. 
More exciting thing is that link:https://github.com/alauda[Alauda] giving a big support wich as a startup company.

WeChat is the greatest media social channel in China. WeChat has one billion users. 
Almost everyone has its own account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events. 
There are over 1k people subscribed the link:https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2MzAwNzU3Nw==&mid=2247483664&idx=1&sn=fa3fb0171d999d345105ce17f8175be7[Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account] in the last three months.

In the new year, I'm looking forward to growing up with you all!
