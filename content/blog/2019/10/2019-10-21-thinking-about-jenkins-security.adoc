Securing a Jenkins server is a multi-layered effort that needs to consider networks, operating systems, applications, source code, and more.
We'll review and explore the layers that secure Jenkins in the link:https://sched.co/UXWy[Thinking about Jenkins Security talk] at link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon[DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019] in Lisbon, Portugal.

Topics will include:

* The **secure by default** configuration that Jenkins provides
* Risks associated with reducing default security settings
* Authentication and authorization alternatives
* Using "**least privilege**" principles
* Jenkins **credentials** and trusted access to resources
* Software updates and Jenkins project security notices

We'll intermix descriptions of good practices with some security horror stories.
The horror stories will remind us of our mistakes, how to detect them, and how to prevent them.

Come join us for the presentation in Lisbon!
