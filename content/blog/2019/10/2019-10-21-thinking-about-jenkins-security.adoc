Securing a Jenkins server is a multi-layered effort that needs to consider networks, operating systems, applications, source code, and more.
At link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon[DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019] in Lisbon, Portugal, we'll review and explore the layers that secure Jenkins.
We'll discuss the **secure by default** configuration that Jenkins provides and the risks associated with reducing default settings.
We'll review authentication and authorization alternatives and how they support granting rights based on "**least privilege**" principles.
We'll discuss Jenkins **credentials** and how they provide trusted access to resources.
We'll talk about software updates and the security notices published by the Jenkins project.

We'll intermix descriptions of good practices with some security horror stories.
The horror stories will remind us of our mistakes, how to detect them, and how to prevent them.

Come join us for the presentation in Lisbon!
