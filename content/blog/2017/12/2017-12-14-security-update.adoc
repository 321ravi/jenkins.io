We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.95 and 2.89.2, that fix two security vulnerabilities.

For an overview of what was fixed, see the link:/security/advisory/2017-11-08[security advisory].
For an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.73/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-73-3[LTS upgrade guide].

We usually announce core security updates well in advance on the link:/mailing-lists[jenkinsci-advisories mailing list], to give Jenkins administrators time to schedule a maintenance.
We have chosen not to do this in this case for two reasons:

* The random failure to set up Jenkins is very noticeable, and given that we've seen automated exploits for link:/security/advisory/2015-10-01/[unprotected Jenkins instances] in the past we consider it important to fix that issue.
* The CSRF issue appears to only affect instances for a very short (seconds at most, if at all) time period immediately after startup, so administrators could apply the fix during the next scheduled Jenkins downtime, rather than immediately.
