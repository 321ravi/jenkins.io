link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld[Jenkins World] is approaching fast,
and we are all busy preparing for the event.
This year, I want to change the way I do the keynote.
I’d like to have a few people come up to the stage and share stories
about the positive impact that recent Jenkins developments like Pipeline and Blue Ocean had enabled.
I'd like to highlight how the new Jenkins
(Jenkinsfile in repo, no more creating jobs, Blue Ocean UI)
is very different from the old Jenkins (freestyle jobs, chaining jobs together, etc.),
and I think the message is more effective when I’m not the only one saying it.

If you are interested, please complete
link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMpoJNDwpDmAqwNUhZT1oRzPs9YZMuPivlUWrMTbI9ZKAOhA/viewform?c=0&w=1[this form]
so that I can reach you.
I think this would be a great opportunity for you as well,
as the rest of the world (and your boss!) get to know your great accomplishments.

You’ll get into Jenkins World for free and get to see the backstage.
If you need to travel long distance to Jenkins World, I’m happy to discuss that.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
