As you probably know, this week we have a
link:/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon].
Over last two days Jenkins contributors have been working on Java 10 and 11 support in Jenkins.
There are 3 days ahead, but we have already achieved some important results we want to share.

### Jenkins Pipeline

One of our major efforts over last 2 days was to get Jenkins Pipeline working on
Java 10 and 11.
We've been working together with Sam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum to fix the libraries in
the Jenkins core and in Pipeline: Support plugin.

Yesterday we have got some foundation Pipeline bits working:

Just to summarize the today's result in one screenshot...

image:/images/post-images/2018-06-19-java10-hackathon-day-2/successful-pipeline.png[Successful Pipeline on Java 10, role=center]

Yes, we have got it running!
Over two days we have got from the "Pipeline Crashes Immediately"
state to the situation when the most of key Pipeline features are
operational.
It includes:

* Scripted and Declarative Pipeline
* BlueOcean
* Shared Libraries support
* Dozens of plugins being used in the Jenkins plugin build flow

There is still a lot of work to do to get the changes finalized,
but Jenkins Pipeline is available for testing on Java 10 and 11 now.
If you want to try it out, you can use a new `jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10`
image we have created.
It bundles all the required patches, so you can just run the following command to get started:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10
```

If you want to try more complex scenarions, see the
