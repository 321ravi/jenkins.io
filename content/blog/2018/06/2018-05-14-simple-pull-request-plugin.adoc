=== About me

I am Abhishek Gautam, 3rd year student from Visvesvaraya National Institute of
technology, India, Nagpur. I was a member of ACM Chapter and Google student developer club of his
college. I am passianate about automation.

=== Project Summary

This is a GSoC 2018 project.

This project aims to develop a Pull request Job Plugin. Users should be able to
configure job type using YAML file which will be placed in root directory of the
Git repository being the subject of the PR. Plugin should interact with various
platfoms like Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, etc whenever a pull request is created or updated.

Plugin should be able to detect the presence of certain types of the report at conventional locations,
and publish them automatically. If the reports are not in a conventional location,
users should be able to specify the location using the YAML file.

==== Benefits to the community

* Project administrators will be able to handle builds for pull requests more easily.
* Build specifications for pull request can be written in a more readable format.
* Build reports will be automatically published to Github, Bitbucket, ect.
* Build status updates will be sent to git servers automatically.
* Users will not have to deal with pipeline code.

=== Prior work

. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/travis-yml-plugin[Travis YML Plugin]: 
  Designed to run .travis.yml as jenkins pipeline job.
  Travis-CI does not support external pull requests hence. And jenkins environment
  is different than Travis and does not always make sense to use configurations
  defined for other environment in jenkins. Also maintenance of this is slowed
  down and last commit for this plugin was on 14 Nov 2016.
  https://github.com/jenkinsci/travis-yml-plugin/commits/master[Click here] to check.

. link:https://github.com/ndeloof/codeship-plugin[CodeShip Plugin]: 
  This plugin is designed to convert codeship "steps.yaml" and
  "services.yaml" to scripted pipeline code. This plugin has never been released.



=== Design

This plugin will be developed on the top of the MultiBranch Pipeline plugin.

For now the plugin is bulding branches and Pull request both using Jenkinsfile.yaml,
but this plugin is inclined to use for pull requests. This will be fixed in next coding phase.

This plugin is following below steps for now:

* clone target repo
* checkout to target branch
* fetch the source branch
* merge source-branch
* call user call user script to build the repo.
* push changes of PR to target branch
* publish test reports

Plugin will start above steps if and only if the pull request is
mergeable, to avoid merge conflicts while merging the source branch to target
branch. Pull requests payload contains information if the pull request changes
are mergeable or not hence, the pull request is mergebale or not can also be
decided by the payload of webhook also.

=== How to run the Plugin

See link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/simple-pull-request-job-plugin/blob/master/README.md[How to run the demo]
and set credentials, owner and repository on your own and you will be good to go.

=== What is avalilable now

. Users are able to select to use Jenkinsfile.yaml for build.
. Git Push step
. harvest results and reports (and post in the PR)
[loweralpha]
.. `junit()`
.. `findbugs()`
.. `archiveArtifacts()`
. Basic interface to parse and get build specifications from YAML file.

=== Things decided

. To build the plugin on the top of multibranch pipeline plugin. As that plugin has implementation of
[loweralpha]
.. Nice interface to show diffrent branch and pull requests build seperately with use of suitable plugins like Github, Bitbucket.
.. Detect trusted revisions in a repository.
.. Publishing of build status to the repository.
. Convert the YAML configuration to declarative pipeline.
. User will provide path to the script relative to the root directory of the repository
  without extension (.sh or .bat) in the YAML file. The plugin will generate pipeline script to detect the
  platform and call .sh or .bat script.
+
  Example:
    Path provided: ./scripts/hello
    a. On UNIX machine “./scripts/hello.sh” will be called
    b. On non-UNIX machine “./scripts/hello.bat” will be called.

=== Implementations till now

A first prototype of the plugin is ready. It supports all features of Multi-Branch Pipeline and offers the following features.

Build description is defined via YAML file stored within the SCM repo. This plugin
will depend on GitHub plugin, Bitbucket plugin, Gitlab plugin if users will be
using respective paltfroms for their repositories.

. Basic conversion of YAML to Declarative Pipeline: A class YamlToPipeline
is written which will load the "Jenkinsfile.yaml" and make use of PipelineSnippetGenerator class
to generate Declarative pipeline code.
. Reporting of results.
. Plugin is using Yaml from target branch right now. (Maybe this needs some discussion, example: 
what if PR contains changes in Jenkinsfile.yaml)
. Git Push step: To push the changes of PR to the target branch. This is implemented  
using git-plugin, PushCommand is used for this from git-plugin. credentialId,
branch name and repository url for intracting with Github, Bitbucket, etc
will be taken automatically from respective plugins plugin. (Yes users have to configure in that way, you can see
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/simple-pull-request-job-plugin/blob/master/README.md[How to run the demo])

=== Jenkinsfile.yaml example

Write now no format has been decided for the yaml file. But for this demo I am using below Jenkinsfile.yaml

image:/images/post-images/gsoc-simple-pull-request-plugin/YAML.png[title="Jenkinsfile.yaml", role="center"]

Below pipeline code will be generated using above yaml file.

=== Coding Phase 2 plans

. Decide a proper YAML format to use for Jenkinsfile.yaml
. Create Step Configurator for SPRP plugin. https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-51637[JENKINS-51637].
This will enable users to use Pipeline steps in Jenkinsfile.yaml.
. Geting rid of manual tab generation in Pipeline SnippetGenerator class.
. Write tests for the plugin.
