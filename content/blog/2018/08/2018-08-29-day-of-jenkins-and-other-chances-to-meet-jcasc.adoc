Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin is reaching a stage when it is almost ready to be used in a production environment (as a matter of fact I know some of living on the edge users already do that). +  
First release candidates are out and the official 1.0 is just around the corner.

I’d like to use that chance to invite you to meet us and contribute to the plugin. There will be plenty opportunities this autumn.

But what is Jenkins Configuration as Code?

In short JCasC is a Jenkins plugin that allows you to store and maintain all your Jenkins configuration in yaml file. It’s a Job DSL for managing Jenkins.

In one of my blogposts: link:https://www.praqma.com/stories/jenkins-configuration-as-code/[Jenkins Configuration as Code - Automating an automation server] I provide a longer explanation of the plugin, and answer questions like “why did we decide to develop it?” and “why you may want to use it?”. I recommend you to read that one if you’re not familiar with the project yet. 

If you’re convinced you want to try it, or already did, please continue reading.

The plugin was presented at a number of meetups - by me but also other contributors. This is my first open source project I actively participate in and I’m quite shocked - positively - how many people decided to join the effort and actively develop the plugin with us. +
And it’s time to take it to the bigger stage and broader audience. So together with Nicolas de Loof I’m gonna present the plugin at *DevOps World | Jenkins World* in _San Francisco_ (19th of September)  and in _Nice_ (24th of October) - yes, Jenkins World is coming to Europe.

But that’s not all! Praqma - company I work for - has organised a number of “Day of Jenkins” events around Scandinavia in past years 
and this October has decided to bring it back with a theme: 2018 Day of Jenkins is link:https://www.code-conf.com/2018/day-of-jenkins-as-code/[*Day of Jenkins [as code\]*]. It’s a double track one day event - presentations and hands-on for users and hackathon for contributors - in that specific case Configuration as Code Plugin’s contributors. 

Detailed agenda is available on the link:https://www.code-conf.com/2018/day-of-jenkins-as-code/[event page] - Jenkins X, Jenkins Evergreen, Jenkins Confguration as Code and more waiting for you!

I really can’t wait to hear what Kohsuke has to say, to introduce you to the plugin during hands-on session I run, and to see what you can come up with during hackathon.

Hope to see you at least at one of those events!
