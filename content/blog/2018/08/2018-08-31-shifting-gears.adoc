Kohsuke here. This is a message for my fellow Jenkins developers.

Jenkins has been on an amazing run, but in part because we've been so good at solving a certain class of problems, the fact that we've been unable to solve other classes of problems are getting more pronounced. I believe we are trapped in a local optimum, and losing appeal to people who fall outside of our traditional sweet spot.

I say it's time we tackle these problems head on. I've been talking to various folks, and I think we need to take on two initiatives. One is what I call "Cloud Native Jenkins," and the other is to insert a jolt in Jenkins. As CTO of CloudBees, we are committed to solving these problems, but this will not succeed without your participation and us collaborating.
