On behalf of the Jenkins GSoC team and mentors,
I would like to welcome
link:https://github.com/cizezsy[Shenyu Zheng],
link:https://github.com/udara28[Udara De Silva],
link:https://github.com/pvtuan10[Pham Vu Tuan] and

They will be working on Google Summer of Code projects in the Jenkins organization, and they have already done some contributions.

If you are interested to know more about GSoC in Jenkins, you can find information about the project, timeline and communication channels here.
This year we will have the following projects:

* link:/images/gsoc/2018/code-coverage-api-plugin[Code Coverage API Plugin] -
create a new API Plugin to unify existing Code Coverage plugins in Jenkins and provide some new features.
* link:/images/gsoc/2018/eda-plugins[Electronic Design Automation Plugins] -
create plugins for open-source Electronic Design Automation tools for synthesis, simulation and coverage analysis (iVerilog, covered, Yosys)
* link:/images/gsoc/2018/remoting-over-message-bus[Jenkins Remoting over Message Bus/Queue ] -
add support of a popular message queue/bus technology (RabbitMQ or Kafka) as a fault-tolerant communication layer in Jenkins
* link:/images/gsoc/2018/simple-pull-request-job-plugin[Simple Pull-Request Job Plugin] -
add ability to define Jenkins jobs as YAML files stored in SCM (configuration-as-code), integrate it with existing plugin ecosystem

During next 4 weeks project teams will be reaching out to potential stakeholders in order to establish connections and to get comments regarding their project designs.
Project designs may change a lot during this Community Bonding phase.

If you have any comments/proposals/concerns, please join the project-specific discussions in the mailing lists once they start. We will appreciate any feedback and help with onboarding.
