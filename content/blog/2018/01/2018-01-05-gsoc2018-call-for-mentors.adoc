This year we are interested in participating in

As in 2016/2017, we are looking for mentors.
So yes, we are looking for you :)

== What is GSoC?

link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual international program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== What do you get?

* A student who works full-time in the area of your interest on for several months
* Joint projects with Jenkins experts, lots of fun and ability to study something together
* Limited-edition of swags from Google and Jenkins project
* Maybe: Participation in GSoC Mentor Summit and other GSoC events/meetups

== Conditions

Mentors are expected to...

* Be passionate about Jenkins
* Lead the project in the area of their interest
* Actively participate in the project during student selection, community bonding and coding phases (March - August)
* Work in teams of 2+ mentors per 1 each student
* Dedicate a consistent and significant amount of time, especially during the coding phase (_~5 hours_ per week in a team of two mentors)

Mentorship does not require strong expertise in Jenkins plugin development.
The main objective is to guide students and to get them involved into the Jenkins community.
If your mentor team requires any specific expertise, GSoC org admins will help to find advisors.

[NOTE]
====
Disclaimer: We cannot guarantee that the Jenkins organization gets accepted to GSoC.
If it gets accepted, we may need to select projects depending on student applications
and the number of allocated project slots.

=== Timeline

* Dec 2017 - started collecting project ideas
* Jan 17 - Status review at the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[Jenkins Governance Meeting].
Outcome: decision whether we apply to GSoC in 2018.
* Jan 21 - Application to GSoC (deadline - Jan 23)
* Feb 12 - List of accepted mentoring organizations published
* Next - If accepted, follow the link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline[GSoC Timeline]

== How to apply?

If you are interested in proposing a project or joining an existing one, please respond to
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/We-14-z_YXU[this thread]
in the Jenkins Developer mailing list.
We kindly ask to do it before *Jan 17, 2017* so that we could add it to the application materials.
Generally it is fine to propose projects till March 12 when the student application phase begins.

Currently we aggregate/review project proposals in
link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2p_XZEdbkcVDMpEPTtjPS15i2Oq3CQgH_geJjPhofY/edit[this document].
In this document you need to briefly describe your project idea and required qualifications from students

Project requirements

* GSoC is about code (though it may and likely should include some documentation and testing work)
* Projects should be about Jenkins (plugins, core, infrastructure, integrations, etc.)
* Projects should be potentially doable by a student in 3-4 months
