This year the Jenkins project introduced a few exciting efforts:
Configuration as Code, Jenkins X, Jenkins Essentials, Blue Ocean and Pipeline. With DevOps World-Jenkins World San Francisco and Nice only a few short months away, we’ve made sure to include these exciting efforts on the agenda. With that said, the agenda for both cities has recently released and will include workshops and deep dive sessions on these efforts and much more.  Project contributors of these efforts will be present at both conferences as well, come say ‘hello’.   Here’s a glimpse of what’s on the agenda:
