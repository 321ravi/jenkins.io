=== Overview
https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin[Remoting Kafka Plugin] is a plugin developed under https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/[Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2018]. The plugin allows users to connect agents to Jenkins master using Kafka to solve the problem of current direct TCP communication between master and agent. A quick introduction of the project could be found in this  https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/06/18/remoting-over-message-bus/[introduction blogpost].

We are currently in the second phase of the project and I am happy to announce that we have recently released alpha version of the plugin under https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/#configuring-jenkins-to-use-experimental-update-center[Experimental Update Center]. You can check the https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG] to see the features developed in this initial release.

=== How to use the plugin?
The instructions to run the plugin in alpha version are written https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin#how-to-use-the-plugin-in-alpha-version[here].
