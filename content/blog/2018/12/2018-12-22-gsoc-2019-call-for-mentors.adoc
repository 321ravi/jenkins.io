NOTE: link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
is as program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project like Jenkins,
at full-time for four months (May to August).
Mentors get actively involved with students starting at the end of February when students start to apply
(see the link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline[timeline]).

We are looking for mentors and project ideas to participate in the 15th edition of the Google Summer of Code program!
We have until February 6th, 2019 at 8pm UTC to submit the application on behalf the Jenkins Organization, but obviously,
we want to be ready before that.

The first step in the process is to have mentors and project ideas.
Then we will apply to Google.
We need Google to accept Jenkins' application to the program itself.
And for this to happen, *we need project proposals and mentors*.

We currently have a link:/projects/gsoc/2019/project-ideas[list of project idea proposals],
and are still accepting new project proposals, mentors, technical advisers, and subject matter experts.

Making a project idea proposal is easy, link:/projects/gsoc/proposing-project-ideas[read the quick start instructions]
or ask us on the link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC SIG Gitter chat].

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).
In return, a student works on your project full time for four months.
Think about the projects that you've always wanted to do but could not find the time...
GSoC is a pretty good return on the investment!

Potential mentors are invited to read the link:/projects/gsoc/mentors[information for mentors] which lists the benefits, expectations
and conflict of interest prevention guidelines.

For any question, you can find the GSoC admins,
mentors and participants on the link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC SIG Gitter chat].
