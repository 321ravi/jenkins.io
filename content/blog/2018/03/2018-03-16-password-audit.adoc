Last year, link:https://thenewstack.io/npm-password-resets-show-developers-need-better-security-practices/[news of compromised passwords being used for accounts able to distribute NPM packages] made the rounds.

Their system looks similar to how publishing of plugins works in the Jenkins project:

* Accounts are protected by passwords chosen by users.
* Individual contributors have permission to release the components they maintain.
* The components they release are used by millions of developers around the world to deliver their software.

In other words, weak passwords are a problem for us just as much as for NPM, and what happened to them could happen to us.

To address this problem, the Jenkins security and infra teams have recently collaborated on a password audit.
We ran brute force tools on the salted password hashes of all accounts with permissions to upload plugins and components, or those accounts with other levels of privileged infrastructure access.

Users with weak passwords -- defined as passwords present in a set of publicly available password lists we've chosen for this audit, and not limited to those associated with e.g. the same email address from password leaks -- were notified via email a few weeks ago that their password is on such a list.

We've repeated this process earlier this week on users whose account password was considered weak before.
Users whose account passwords were still not considered "strong" (i.e. they did not change their password themselves, or changed it to another weak password) got their password invalidated and will need to request a password reset.

We plan to implement further safeguards, like improving the account management app at https://account.jenkins.io to reject weak passwords.
