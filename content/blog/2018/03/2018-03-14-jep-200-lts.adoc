[NOTE]
====
This is a post about a major change in Jenkins, which is available starting
from Jenkins 2.102 and Jenkins LTS 2.107.1.
This is a change with a serious risk of regressions in plugins.
If you are a Jenkins administrator, please read this blogpost and
link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.107/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-107-1[upgrade guidelines]
*BEFORE* upgrading.
====

I would like to provide some heads-up about
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/200/README.adoc[JEP-200],
which is going to land in the new Jenkins LTS baseline.
JEP-200 is â€œjust the biggest incompatible change to Jenkins in recent memory" according to link:https://github.com/jglick[Jesse Glick],
and I highly recommend to read guidelines below to minimize potential impact on your instances.

== Background

JEP-200 has been integrated into Jenkins weekly builds
and (if all goes well) will be a part of the next LTS line.
Originally this change has been introduced in Jenkins 2.102 (released in January 2018), and it got a lot of testing over last 2 months.
See link:/blog/2018/01/13/jep-200/[this blogpost] for the original announcement.

Jenkins used to specifically _blacklist_ certain classes and packages according to known or suspected exploits.
This approach has been proven unsustainable due to the risk of deserialization attacks via unknown classes
from 3rd-party components, and in JEP-200 we aim to prevent this risk.
The change implies some collateral damage to plugins serializing non-whitelisted Java-internal and 3rd-party classes,
see link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[Plugins affected by JEP-200].

== Current state

Over last 2 months we received more than 75 regression reports from users of Jenkins weekly releases.
All these issues got triaged, and we got the most of the fixes released.
More than *50 plugins* got fixed, and much more plugins got updates in order to enable compatibility testing.
Thanks a lot to all Jenkins contributors and plugin maintainers who helped to timely deliver changes for this story!

Over last 6 weeks Jenkins weekly releases had good community ratings,
so we feel that the change is ready to go in LTS.
On the other hand, we continue receiving JEP-200 regression notifications.
They are mostly caused by niche plugins which are not widely used in weekly releases,
and unfortunately not all fixes got released in time (see link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[the Wiki page] for up-to-date info).
We anticipate more regressions to be reported after the LTS release and adoption by big installations.

In order to simplify the upgrade to the new LTS baseline,
we prepared some enablement materials together with link:https://github.com/bitwiseman[Liam Newman]
and link:https://github.com/jglick[Jesse Glick].

== For Jenkins administrators

Upgrading to a core with JEP-200 requires a special update procedure, which is described below.

=== Upgrading Jenkins

. JEP-200 is not the only major change in 2.107.1, please read
the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.107/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-107-1[full upgrade guide] carefully
. If you have a way of testing the upgrade before applying it to production, do it
. **BACKUP YOUR INSTANCE** so you have any easy way of rolling back
. Update all affected plugins.
See link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[this Wiki page] for the list of affected plugins,
fix statuses and workarounds
. Apply workarounds for non-released patches if needed (see below)
. Update to the new version of the Jenkins core

Using backups and staging servers is good advice before _any_ upgrade but especially this one,
with a relatively high risk of regression.
Due to the nature of the changes, some plugins may refuse to load after the upgrade and cause denial of the service.

=== After the upgrade

To the extent that advance testing of the impact of this change on popular plugins has been completed,
most users (and even plugin developers) should not notice any difference.
So it is highly advised to monitor your system after the upgrade, especially the following cases:

* Jenkins System log (especially during the startup)
* Build logs

If you do encounter a log message with the `https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/` link,
most likely you have found a JEP-200 regression.
Example:

----
some.pkg.and.ClassName in file:/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/some-plugin-name/WEB-INF/lib/some-library-1.2.jar might be dangerous, so rejecting; see https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/
----

If you see such message, we highly recommend reporting it so that it can be investigated and probably fixed quickly.

=== Reporting JEP-200 issues

Please report it in the link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins issue tracker], under the appropriate plugin component.
Before reporting please check whether there are already reported issues.

. Add the `JEP-200` label
. Link the newly created issue to link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47736[JENKINS-47736]
. Include the stacktrace you see in the log
. If possible, include complete steps to reproduce the problem from scratch

You can find examples of the reported issues using link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20JEP-200[this query].

Jenkins developers will strive to evaluate the reason for the violation and offer a fix in the form of a core and/or plugin update.
Right after the feature release there will be a special team triaging the reports with high priority
See link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/200#rollout-plan[JEP-200 Maintenance plan] for more info.

For more details and current status, see
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[Plugins affected by fix for JEP-200].

=== Applying workarounds

Assuming you see no particular reason to think that the class in question has dangerous deserialization semantics, which is rare,
it is possible to work around the problem in your own installation as a temporary expedient.
Note class name(s) mentioned in the JEP-200 log messages,
and run Jenkins with the `hudson.remoting.ClassFilter` startup option, e.g.:

----
java -Dhudson.remoting.ClassFilter=some.pkg.and.ClassName,some.pkg.and.OtherClassName -jar jenkins.war ...
----

Your mileage may vary depending on Jenkins packaging and installation.
Such update may require several iterations, because classes whitelisted in the workaround may also
include fields with types requiring whitelisting.

== For plugin developers

If you are a plugin developer, please see link:/blog/2018/01/13/jep-200/[the original JEP-200 announcement].
This blogpost provides guidelines about testing and fixing plugin compatibility after the JEP-200 changes.

The presentation above also provides some information about what needs to be tested.
