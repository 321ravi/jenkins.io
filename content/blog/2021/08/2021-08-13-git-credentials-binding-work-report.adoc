= Git Credentials Binding for sh, bat, powershell

== Abstract

This project proposes to implement two new credential bindings to perform authenticated operations using command line git in Jenkins pipeline job/freestyle project.

The two credential bindings are `gitSshPrivateKey` and `gitUsernamePassword`.

== Implementation

Type::
Feature

Location::
Both `gitUsernamePassword` and `gitSshPrivateKey` bindings are implemented in Jenkins https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/[git-plugin] v4.8.0.

Dependencies::
1. https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/[Credentials Binding Plugin]-
It is used to bind Git specific environment variables with shell scripts/commands which perform git authentication on behalf of the user, without their interaction with the command-line.

2. https://plugins.jenkins.io/bouncycastle-api/[Bouncy Castle API Plugin]-
Provides an API to do common tasks like PEM/PKCS#8 Encoding/Decoding and ensuring its stability among BC versions.

3. https://plugins.jenkins.io/sshd/[SSHD Plugin]-
Provides an API to perform tasks like OpenSSH Encoding/Decoding.

== Phase 1: Git Username Password Binding

* Git credential binding to support authentication over HTTP protocol
** Integration with Credentials Binding Plugin
** Choosing git-plugin to support the implementation
* Support different
** _OS environments_: CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Debian 9, Debian 10, FreeBSD 12, OpenBSD 6.9, openSUSE 15.2, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 21.04, and Windows 10.
** _Processors_: amd64, arm32, arm64, and s390x.
* Authentication support for Cli Git only, not JGit or JGit Apache.
** Check for specific git versions
** Setting git specific environment variables based on OS type
* Automated test coverage more that 90%
