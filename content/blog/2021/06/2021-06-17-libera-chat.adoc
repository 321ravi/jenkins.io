The link:/chat/#internet-relay-chat-irc[Jenkins IRC channels] have moved to Libera chat.
Many Jenkins developers have been dropped without warning from the previous Jenkins IRC chat system on Freenode.
Rather than remain in a system that was increasingly unfriendly to our developers and administrators, the Jenkins community has moved to link:https://libera.chat/[Libera Chat IRC].

A more detailed history of the transition is available on the link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/pEcun5ZSfgo/m/ztRg03VNAgAJ[Jenkins developers mailing list].
Special thanks to Tim Jacomb, Gavin Mogan, Alex Earl, and Olivier Vernin for their work on the migration of IRC channels and automation.

Other Jenkins chat systems like link:/chat/#gitter[Gitter] and link:/chat/#slack[Slack] are unchanged.
