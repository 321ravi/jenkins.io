title: Using Jenkins to build a Node.js/React project
section: doc
---

:toc:
:imagesdir: /doc/book/resources

This tutorial shows you how to build a simple
https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]/&zwj;https://reactjs.org/[React] application
using the https://www.npmjs.com/[Node Package Manager (npm)], whose overall
build process will be orchestrated in Jenkins.

If you are a Node.js/React developer who is new to CI/CD concepts, or you might
be familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement building your
project using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Node.js/React application (which you'll obtain from a sample
repository on GitHub) generates a web page with the content "Welcome to React"
and is accompanied by a test to check that the application renders
satisfactorily.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<download-and-run-jenkins-in-docker,downloaded and run Jenkins in Docker>> from
link:..[another introductory tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

=== Fork and clone the sample repository on GitHub

Obtain the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js/React application from GitHub, by
forking the sample repository of the application's source code into your own
GitHub account and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a GitHub account,
  sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/gilesgas/simple-node-js-react-app[`simple-node-js-react-app`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Begin cloning your forked `simple-node-js-react-app` repository (on GitHub)
  locally to your machine by opening up a terminal/command line window to the
  directory in which the repository will be cloned. This tutorial assumes that
  `simple-node-js-react-app` will be cloned within the following directories on
  these platforms, which you should `cd` into now:
* macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub`
* Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub`
* Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub`

+
where `<your-username>` is your user account's name on your operating system.

+
*Note:*

** On a Windows machine, use a Git bash command line window (as opposed to the
   usual Microsoft command prompt).
** Alternatively, and in particular if you have the GitHub Desktop app installed
   on your machine, in GitHub, you can click the green *Clone or download*
   button on your forked repository and follow the instructions to clone the
   repository locally. If you use GitHub Desktop, you can omit the following
   step.

+
. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
  `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-node-js-react-app` +
  where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. Go back to Jenkins, log in again if necessary and click *create new jobs*
  under *Welcome to Jenkins!* +
  *Note:* If you don't see this, click *New Item* at the top left.
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project (e.g. `simple-node-js-react-app`).
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
. ( _Optional_ ) On the next page, specify a brief description for your Pipeline
  in the *Description* field (e.g. `An entry-level Pipeline demonstrating how to
  build a simple Node.js React project using Jenkins.`)
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
  This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from Source Control
  Management (SCM), which will be your locally cloned Git repository.
. From the *SCM* field, choose *Git*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, specify the directory path of your locally
  cloned repository <<fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github,above>>,
  which is from your user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to
  the `/home` directory of the Jenkins/Blue Ocean container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-app`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-app`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-app`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. You're now ready to begin
  creating your `Jenkinsfile`, which you'll be checking into your locally cloned
  Git repository.


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You're now ready to create your Pipeline that will automate building your
Node.js/React project in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a
`Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to your locally cloned Git repository
(`simple-node-js-react-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous
delivery pipeline a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like
any other code. Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, create an initial Pipeline to download a Node Docker image and run it as
a Docker container (which will build your simple Node.js/React application).
Also add a "Build" stage to the Pipeline that begins orchestrating this whole
process.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save new text file with the
  name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-node-js-react-app` Git
  repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:6-alpine' // <1>
            args '-p 3000:3000' // <2>
        }
    }
    environment {
        CI = 'true' // <3>
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <4>
            steps {
                sh 'npm install' // <5>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/_/node/[`node:6-apline` Docker image] (if it's not
already available in your Docker host) and runs this image as a separate
container. This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins/Blue Ocean and Node containers running locally in
  Docker.
* The Node container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to build your Pipeline project. However, this container is
  short-lived - its lifespan is only that of the duration of your Pipeline's
  execution.
<2> This `args` parameter makes the Node container (temporarily) accessible
through port 3000. The significance of this is explained in a subsequent section
of this tutorial.
<3> Sets the environment variable `CI` with a boolean value of `true`, which is
available to all other steps in this Pipeline. Again, the significance of this
is explained in a subsequent section of this tutorial.
<4> Defines a stage called `Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<5> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the `npm` command to ensure that all dependencies required to run
your application have been downloaded to the local `node_modules` directory
(i.e. within the `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-node-js-react-app`
directory in the Jenkins/Blue Ocean container).
+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-node-js-react-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-node-js-react-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git add .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and click *Open Blue
  Ocean* on the left to access Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. In the *This job has not been run* message box, click *Run*, then quickly
  click the *OPEN* link which appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins
  building your Pipeline project. If you weren't able to click the *OPEN* link,
  click the row on the main Blue Ocean interface to access this feature.

+
*Note:* You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
After making a clone of your local `simple-node-js-react-app` Git repository
itself, Jenkins:

.. Initially queues the project to be built on the agent.
.. Downloads the Node Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker. +
   image:tutorials/java-maven-01-downloading-maven-docker-image.png[alt="Downloading
   Node Docker image",width=100%]
.. Executes the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Maven
   container. During this time, `npm` will download many dependencies necessary
   to run your Node.js/React application, which will ultimately be stored in the
   local `node_modules` directory (within the Jenkins home directory). +

The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js/React
application successfully. +
