=== Download and run Jenkins in Docker

In this tutorial, you'll be running Jenkins as a Docker container from the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[`jenkinsci/blueocean`] Docker
image. Read more about these concepts in the
link:/doc/book/installing/#docker[Docker] and
link:/doc/book/installing/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker[Downloading
and running Jenkins in Docker] sections of the
link:/doc/book/installing/[Installing Jenkins] page.

*Tip:* If you've already run though this procedure (perhaps from link:..[another
introductory tutorial]), then you can skip this section and
<<fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github,jump to the next>>. However,
if it's been a while since you last ran through this procedure, then it is
recommended that you re-run `docker run ...` command below again (if you haven't
already done so recently) to acquire any updates to this Docker image.

. Open up a terminal/command prompt window.
. Run the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image as a container in Docker using the
  following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command (bearing in mind that this command automatically downloads the image
  if this hasn't been done):
** *On macOS and Linux:*
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -u root \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ # <1>
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \ # <2>
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
<1> Maps the `/var/jenkins_home` directory in the container to the Docker
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/[volume] with the name
`jenkins-data`. If this volume does not exist, then this `docker run` command
will automatically create the volume for you.
<2> Maps the `$HOME` directory on the host (i.e. your local) machine (usually
the `/Users/<your-username>` directory) to the `/home` directory in the
container.
+
*Note:* If copying and pasting the command snippet above doesn't work, try
copying and pasting this annotation-free version here:
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -u root \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----

+
** *On Windows:* +
  The following command is effectively the same command shown for macOS/Linux
  above but the `-v "$HOME":/home` is replaced with `-v "%HOMEPATH%":/home`
  (assuming that your user home directory on Windows is on the C drive). Also,
  if you're using the Windows command prompt, replace the backslash symbols `\`
  at the end of each line with carat symbols instead `^`, giving you:
+
----
docker run ^
  --rm ^
  -u root ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  -v "%HOMEPATH%":/home ^
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----

+
If you have some experience with Docker, you can add an option like `--name
jenkins-tutorials`, which would give the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container the
name "jenkins-tutorials". This makes it easier to refer to the container if, for
instance you wish to access the container through a terminal/command prompt.

+
. After the 2 sets of asterisks appear in the terminal/command prompt window,
  browse to `http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears.
+

page",width=100%] +
. From your terminal/command prompt window again, copy the
  automatically-generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of
  asterisks).
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-02-copying-initial-admin-password.png[alt="Copying
initial admin password",width=100%] +
. On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password in the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*.
. On the *Customize Jenkins* page, click *Install suggested plugins*. The
  *Getting Started* page is displayed, showing the progression of Jenkins being
  configured and the suggested plugins being installed. (This process may take a
  few minutes.)
. When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify your details in the
  respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
. When the *Jenkins is ready* page appears, click *Start using Jenkins*. +
  *Notes:*
* This page may indicate *Jenkins is almost ready!* instead and if so, click
  *Restart*.
* If the page doesn't automatically refresh after a minute, use your web browser
  to refresh the page manually.
. If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just
  created and you're ready to start using Jenkins!

Throughout the remainder of this tutorial, you can stop the Jenkins/Blue Ocean
Docker container by typing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal/command prompt window from
which you ran the `docker run ...` command above.

To restart the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container, run the same `docker run
...` command you ran in step 2 (above).
