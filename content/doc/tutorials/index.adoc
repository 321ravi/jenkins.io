This part of the Jenkins User Documentation contains a series of simple
introductory tutorials to help you begin building your project in an automated
fashion with Jenkins.

If you're a developer with little understanding of Continuous Integration (CI)
or Continuous Delivery (CD) concepts, or a developer who might be familiar with
these principles but don't know how to implement them in Jenkins, then these
tutorials are a great place for you start.

Please choose the tutorial that's relvant to your technology stack:
