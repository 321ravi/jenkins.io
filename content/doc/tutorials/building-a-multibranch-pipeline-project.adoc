title: Using Jenkins to build a multibranch Pipeline project
section: doc

:toc:

:imagesdir: /doc/book/resources

This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building a simple
https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] and https://reactjs.org/[React] application
with the https://www.npmjs.com/[Node Package Manager (npm)], _as well as_
selectively delivering the results for development and production purposes.

Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended that you run through at least
one of the initial set of link:../#introductory-tutorials[Introductory
tutorials] from the link:..[Tutorials overview] page first to familiarize
yourself with CI/CD concepts (relevant to a technology stack you're most
familiar with), how these concepts are implemented in Jenkins and the
fundamentals of Jenkins Pipelines.

This tutorial uses the same application that the
link:../building-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[Using Jenkins to build a
Node.js and React application with npm] tutorial is based on. Therefore, you'll
be building the same application although this time, from different Git branches
that selectively execute different stages of a Pipeline depending on the Git
branch that your Jenkins build is running on.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 30-50 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

=== Fork and clone the sample repository on GitHub

Obtain the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js and React application from GitHub,
by forking the sample repository of the application's source code into your own
GitHub account and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
  GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/gilesgas/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project[`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Begin cloning your forked `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository
  (on GitHub) locally to your machine by opening up a terminal/command line
  window to the directory in which the repository will be cloned. This tutorial
  assumes that `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` will be cloned within
  the following directories on these platforms, which you should `cd` into now:
* macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub`
* Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub`
* Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub`

+
where `<your-username>` is your user account's name on your operating system.

+
*Note:*

** On a Windows machine, use a Git bash command line window (as opposed to the
   usual Microsoft command prompt).
** Alternatively, and in particular if you have the GitHub Desktop app installed
   on your machine, in GitHub, you can click the green *Clone or download*
   button on your forked repository and follow the instructions to clone the
   repository locally. If you use GitHub Desktop, you can omit the following
   step.

+
. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
  `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` +
  where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create development and production branches in your repository

Before creating your Pipeline project in Jenkins, create "development" and
"production" branches of your locally cloned Git repository. You'll be creating
a single Jenkinsfile (initially in the `master` branch, which you'll pull into
the other branches) whose stages will be selectively executed based on the
branch that Jenkins is building from.

Within the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory (i.e. your local
clone of the sample repository):

. Run the following commands to create
  these branches (from the contents of the `master` branch):
* `git branch development` +
  and
* `git branch production`
. Check that these branches now exist by running the command `git branch`, which
  should give you:
+
[source,bash]
----
  development
* master
  production
----
. If the asterisk (indicating the current branch) does not appear next to
  `master`, run the command `git checkout master` to ensure that `master` is the
  current branch.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean

Whenever you create _any_ Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, Jenkins actually
creates this as a multibranch Pipeline project behind the scenes. This becomes
apparent if you were to access Jenkins's classic interface after creating a
Pipeline project in Blue Ocean; you'll see that Jenkins will have created your
project as a "Multibranch Pipeline" project.

. Go back to Jenkins and ensure you have accessed the Blue Ocean interface. To
  do this, make sure you:
* have browsed to `http://localhost:8080/blue` and are logged in +
  or
* have browsed to `http://localhost:8080/`, are logged in and have clicked *Open
  Blue Ocean* on the left.
. In the *Welcome to Jenkins* box at the center of the Blue Ocean interface,
  click *Create a new Pipeline* to begin the Pipeline creation wizard. +
  *Note:* If you don't see this box, click *New Pipeline* at the top right.
. In *Where do you store your code?*, click *Git* (_not_ *GitHub*).
. In the *Repository URL* field (within *Connect to a Git repository*), specify
  the directory path of your locally cloned repository
  <<fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github,above>>, which is from your
  user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to the `/home`
  directory of the Jenkins/Blue Ocean container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. +
  Blue Ocean detects the presence of the `Jenkinsfile` "Pipeline stub" in each
  branch and proceeds to run each Pipeline against its respective branch, whose
  build results are shown on the *Activity* page of the main Blue Ocean
  interface.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-01-main-blueocean-interface.png[alt="Main
Blue Ocean interface",width=100%]

[NOTE]
====
The Pipeline stub consists of the basic requirements for a valid Pipeline - i.e.
an link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`] and a
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stages[`stages`] section, as well as a
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stage[`stage`] directive.

The reason why the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository includes
a `Jenkinsfile` Pipeline stub is that its presence in a branch makes Blue Ocean
detect that there's something to build (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) immediately
after creating the Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, which in turn makes these
branches accessible through the Blue Ocean interface.

If you created a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean but didn't have a Jenkinsfile in
one or more of your repository's branches, then to access the branches in Blue
Ocean after subsequently pulling in/adding a `Jenkinsfile` to these branches,
either:

* Use the *Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now* feature in the Multibranch Pipeline
  project (accessible through Jenkins's classic interface), +
  or
* Implement webhooks into your Git repository.
====


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile with build and test stages

You're now ready to create the Pipeline that will automate building your Node.js
and React application in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a
`Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to the `master` branch of your locally
cloned Git repository (`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`).

First, create an initial Pipeline to download a Node Docker image and run it as
a Docker container that will build your simple Node.js and React application.
Also add a "Build" stage to the Pipeline to begin orchestrating this whole
process and a "Test" stage to check that the application renders satisfactorily.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, open the existing `Jenkinsfile` at the
  root of your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository
  and clear its contents. +
  *Note:* Be sure you are performing this step on the `master` branch of your
  repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:6-alpine'
            args '-p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000' // <1>
        }
    }
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `args` parameter makes the Node container (temporarily) accessible
through ports 3000 and 5000. The significance of this is explained in the
`jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-deployment.sh` and
`jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh` files of your cloned repository, and
are covered in subsequent sections of this tutorial.
+
*Note:* For an explanation of the other components of this `Jenkinsfile`, refer
to the annotations of the Declarative Pipeline at the
link:../building-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile[``Create
your initial Pipeline...''] and
link:../building-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add
a test stage...''] sections of the
link:../building-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/[Using Jenkins to build a
Node.js and React application with npm] tutorial.
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile with 'Test' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-11-branches-page.png[alt="Branches
page",width=100%]
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `master` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the *OPEN*
  link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building the
  `master` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able to click
  the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity* page to
  access this feature. +
  Within a few minutes, the Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built
  your Node.js and React application successfully from your `master` branch.
[.boxshadow]

and test stages run successfully with output",width=100%]
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface.


=== Add deliver and deploy stages to your Pipeline

Next, add "Deliver for development" and "Deploy for production" stages to your
Pipeline, which Jenkins will selectively execute based on the based on the
branch that Jenkins is building from.

This takes the "Pipeline-as-Code" concept to a new level, in which a single
`Jenkinsfile` describes your project's entire build, test, delivery and
deployment processes in Jenkins for each branch of your repository. Read more
about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:6-alpine'
            args '-p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000'
        }
    }
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development' // <1>
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'  // <1>
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> These link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#when[`when`] directives (along with
their `branch` conditions) determine whether or not the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stage[`stages`] (containing these `when`
directives) should be executed. If a `branch` condition's value (i.e. pattern)
matches the name of the branch that Jenkins is running the build from, then the
`stage` that contains this `when` and `branch` construct will be executed.
+
*Notes:*
* For an explanation of the `input message` steps, refer to annotation *4* of
  the Declarative Pipeline at the
  link:../building-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-final-deliver-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add
  a final deliver stage...'' section of the building a Node.js and React
  application] tutorial.
* For an explanation of the `deliver-for-development.sh`,
  `deploy-for-production.sh` and `kill.sh` script steps, refer to the contents
  of these files located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the root of the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` respository.
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver...' and 'Deploy...' stages"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `master` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the *OPEN*
  link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building the
  `master` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able to click
  the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity* page to
  access this feature. +
  Notice how Jenkins skips the last two stages you added, since the branch you
  are running the build from (`master`) does not meet the `when` directives in
  these stages.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-21-complete-pipeline-runs-successfully-on-master-branch.png[alt="Complete
Pipeline runs successfully on the 'master' branch",width=100%]
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface.


=== Pull your updated Jenkinsfile into the other repository branches

Now that you have a completed `Jenkinsfile` to build your application in
Jenkins, you can pull this file from the `master` branch of your repository into
its `development` and `production` branches.

Within the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory of your local
repository:

. Run the following commands to pull changes from `master` to
  `development`:
* `git checkout development` +
  and
* `git pull . master`
. Also run the following commands to pull changes from `master` to `production`:
* `git checkout production` +
  and
* `git pull . master`

+
Your `development` and `production` branches should now have all your
`Jenkinsfile` updates you made on the `master` branch.


=== Run your Pipeline on the development branch

. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `development` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the
  *OPEN* link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building
  the `development` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able
  to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity*
  page to access this feature.
. Within a few minutes and when the build pauses, ensure you are viewing the
  *Deliver for development* stage (click it if necessary), click the top green
  *Shell Script* step to expand its contents and scroll down until you see the
  `http://localhost:3000` link.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-31-deliver-for-development-stage-opened.png[alt="Shell
Script step 'Deliver for development' stage opened",width=100%] +
  *Note:* Since you are building the application on a different branch, the `npm
  install` step will require a few minutes for `npm` to download the many
  dependencies required to run your Node.js and React application (stored in a
  local `node_modules` directory within the Jenkins home directory). These
  dependencies are downloaded again because this Jenkins build would be the
  first time you are running your Pipeline project on the `development` branch
  and each branch has its own workspace directory (containing its own
  `node_modules` directory) within the Jenkins home directory.
. Click the `http://localhost:3000` link to view your Node.js and React
  application running (in development mode) in a new web browser tab. You should
  see a page/site with the title *Welcome to React* on it.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, click the *Proceed* button in
  Blue Ocean to complete the Pipeline's execution. +
  The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js and React
  application successfully from your `development` branch. Notice how the
  *Deliver for development* stage was executed but the *Deploy for production*
  stage was not.
[.boxshadow]

. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface.


=== Run your Pipeline on the production branch

. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `production` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the
  *OPEN* link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building
  the `production` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able to
  click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity* page
  to access this feature.
. Within a few minutes and when the build pauses, ensure you are viewing the
  *Deploy for production* stage (click it if necessary), click the top green
  *Shell Script* step to expand its contents and scroll down until you see the
  `http://localhost:5000` link.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-41-deploy-for-production-stage-opened.png[alt="Shell
Script step 'Deploy for production' stage opened",width=100%] +
. Click the `http://localhost:5000` link to view your Node.js and React
  application in a new web browser tab. This will be running in production mode
  from a production build of your source code. Again, you should see a page/site
  with the title *Welcome to React* on it. However, this time, the contents are
  served by the `npm serve` module and likely to be cached by your browser.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, click the *Proceed* button in
  Blue Ocean to complete the Pipeline's execution. +
  The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js and React
  application successfully from your `development` branch. Notice how the
  *Deliver for development* stage was executed but the *Deploy for production*
  stage was not.
