section: doc
---

:toc:

This tutorial shows you how to automate building a simple Java project (built
with Maven) using Jenkins.

If you are a Java/Maven developer who is new to CI/CD concepts, or you might be
familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement building your
project using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<download-and-run-jenkins-in-docker,downloaded and run Jenkins in Docker>> from
link:..[another introductory tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

=== Fork and clone the sample repository on GitHub

In this tutorial, we'll be building a simple Java application using Maven, whose
overall build process will be orchestrated in Jenkins. This Java application
(which you'll obtain from a sample repository on GitHub) simply outputs the
string "Hello world!" and is accompanied by a unit test to check that the main
application works as expected.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. +
  *Tip:* If you don't yet have a GitHub account, you can sign up for a free one
  on the https://github.com/[GitHub website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/gilesgas/simple-java-maven-app[`simple-java-maven-app`] on
  GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Begin cloning your forked `simple-java-maven-app` repository (on GitHub)
  locally to your machine by opening up a terminal window to the directory in
  which the repo will be cloned. In this tutorial, we'll assume that
  `simple-java-maven-app` will be cloned into:
* `/Users/<your-username>/GitHub/Documents` for Mac OS X,
* `/home/<your-username>/GitHub` for Linux or
* `C:\Users\<your-username>\GitHub\Documents` for Windows,
+
where `<your-username>` is your user account's name on your operating system.
+
*Note:*

** On a Windows machine, use a Git bash command prompt window (as opposed to the
   usual Microsoft command prompt).
** Alternatively, and in particular if you have the GitHub Desktop app installed
   on your machine, in GitHub, you can click the green *Clone or download*
   button on your forked repository and follow the instructions to clone the
   repository locally. If you use GitHub Desktop, you can omit the following
   step.

+
. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
  `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-java-maven-app` +
  where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. Go back to Jenkins, log in again if necessary and click *create new jobs*
  under *Welcome to Jenkins!*
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project. In this tutorial, we'll assume `simple-java-maven-app`.
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
. ( _Optional_ ) On the next page, specify a brief description for your Pipeline
  in the *Description* field (e.g. `An entry-level Pipeline demonstrating how to
  build a simple Java Maven project using Jenkins.`)
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
  This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from Source Control
  Management (SCM), which will be your locally cloned Git repository.
. From the *SCM* field, choose *Git*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, specify the directory path of your locally
  cloned repo above - i.e.
* `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` for Mac OS X,
* `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app` for Linux or
* `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-java-maven-app` for Windows.
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. You're now ready to begin
  creating your `Jenkinsfile`, which you'll be checking into your cloned Git
  repo.


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You're now ready to create your Pipeline that will automate building your
Java/Maven project in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a `Jenkinsfile`,
which will be committed to your locally cloned Git repository
(`simple-java-maven-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous
delivery pipeline a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like
any other code. Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, we'll create an initial Pipeline to download and run a Maven in Docker
(which will build your simple Java application) and then add a build stage that
orchestrates this process.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save new text file with the
  name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git
  repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3-alpine' // <1>
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2' // <2>
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <3>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package' // <4>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/[`maven:3-apline` Docker image] (if it's not
already available in your Docker host) and runs this image as a separate
container. This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins/Blue Ocean and Maven containers running locally
  in Docker.
* This Maven container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to build your Pipeline project. However, this container is
  short-lived - its lifespan is that of the duration of your Pipeline's
  execution.
<2> This `args` parameter creates a reciprocal mapping between the `/root/.m2`
directories in the short-lived Maven Docker container and that of your Docker
host's filesystem. Explaining the details behind this is beyond the scope of
this tutorial. However, the reason for doing this is to ensure that the
artifacts necessary to build your Java application (which Maven downloads while
your Pipeline is being executed) are retained beyond the lifespan of the Maven
container.
<3> Defines a stage called `Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<4> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the Maven command to cleanly build your Java application (without
running any tests).
+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repo.
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and click *Open Blue
  Ocean* on the left to access Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. In the *This job has not been run* message box, click *Run*, then quickly
  click the *OPEN* link which appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins
  building your Pipeline project. If you weren't able to click the *OPEN* link,
  click the row on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature.

+
*Note:* You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
After making a clone of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repo itself,
Jenkins:

.. Initially queues the project to be built on the agent.
.. Downloads the Maven Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
.. Executes the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Maven
   container. During this time, Maven will download many artifacts necessary to
   build your Java application, which will ultimately be stored in Jenkins's
   local Maven repository (and the `maven-repository` Docker data volume).


=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Build` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
----
+
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3-alpine'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
+
<1> Defines a new stage called `Test` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the Maven command to run a unit test on your simple Java
application.
+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repo.
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature.


=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver') {
            steps {
                sh './Jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh'
            }
        }
----
+
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3-alpine'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh './Jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
+
<1> Defines a new stage called `Deliver` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the shell script `deliver.sh` located in the `Jenkins/scripts`
directory from the root of the `simple-java-maven-app` repository.

+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repo.
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature.

+
*Warning:* It's possible that since Maven downloads artifacts during this final
`Deliver` stage, Maven will attempt to run some of the other commands further
down the `sh` step before the artifacts have finished downloading. This will
cause the build to fail. If you notice the build failing the first time, run
the Pipeline project again and it should succeed.
