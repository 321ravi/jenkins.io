WARNING: The Jenkins wiki was made 'read-only' in link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/lNmas8aBRrI/eL3u7A6qBwAJ[October 2019].
Plugin documentation should be maintained in the GitHub repository of the plugin.
See the link:../documentation[plugin documentation guidelines] for details.

Plugin documentation is available from the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[Jenkins plugins site] so that potential users can learn about the plugin without installing it.

== Migrating from Wiki to GitHub

Document migration can be done in a semi-automated way using the link:https://pandoc.org[Pandoc] tool for Wiki conversion to Markdown or Asciidoc.
This guide shows how to do so for a common case when the documentation page is going to be sourced from the README file inside the repository's root.

NOTE: If there is no ticket for the documentation migration created by the current plugin maintainers,
make sure to create one and then discuss with the plugin maintainers.
Similarly, Asciidoc/Markdown preferences should be also discussed with maintainers.

There are the following migration steps:

. Fork the plugin repository in GitHub and clone it to the local machine.
. Export the documentation. It can be done in a manual or automated way, see below
. Add the documentation and images to the repository
** You can merge the exported file with the existing README file or create a new one.
. Copy-edit the documentation, see below
. Modify the URL documentation page reference in the project file so that it points to GitHub (link:/doc/developer/publishing/documentation/#referencing-the-documentation-page-from-the-project-file[documentation]).
. Commit changes, push them to your fork and create a pull request against the repository.

=== Exporting Wiki documentation (automatic way)

The link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki Exporter] can export plugin documentation to Markdown or Asciidoc.

. Go to the link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki Exporter] service
. Specify the plugin Wiki URL or ID in the field
. Select the export option. For plugins with images you will need to use _Markdown Zip_ or _Asciidoc Zip_  
. Click _Convert_ to do the conversion. It will either show the converted file or provide the archive to download

=== Exporting Wiki documentation (manual way)

. Open the plugin's Wiki page page you want to migrate.
. In the "..." button in the top right corner click the _View Source_ action. A new window will open.
. Save the document as HTML to the repository, e.g. as `myplugin.html`.
. Call `pandoc -o myplugin.md --extract-media=docs/images myplugin.html` to export Markdown.
  Asciidoc format can be used as well, with the `.adoc` extension.
. Cleanup documentation. 
  link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki Exporter] does some bits automatically, but you may need to apply manual updates here.
** Remove the macro references in the top of the document, if any.

=== Reviewing the documentation

. Review/edit the exported file formatting
** If the document includes "Table of contents", remove this section in Markdown 
   or replace it by `:toc:` macros in Asciidoc (link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/.github/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc[example]).
** If the source Wiki page includes code blocks, they will need to be manually converted. 
   Pandoc exports them as tables.
. Extract changelogs to a separate file
** It is recommended to extract changelogs to a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file in the repository root.
   It allows tools like Dependabot to read changelog summaries
** Use versions as headers.
   Changelogs in Wiki often include release dates, but it is better to keep them in the text below the header.
** Examples: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/envinject-api-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[EnvInject API Plugin], link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/aws-java-sdk-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[AWS Java SDK Plugin]
. Review the text
** Verify formatting and spelling
** Wiki pages are often outdated, and it is nice to review them before submitting 
   (e.g. rename "slave" to "agent", "workflow" to "pipeline", "Hudson" to "Jenkins", etc.)
. Commit changes, push them to your fork and create a pull request against the plugin repository
. Once the pull request is merged, create an `INFRA` Jenkins JIRA ticket to replace the content on Wiki by a link to the new jenkins.io locations
