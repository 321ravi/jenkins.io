The Jenkins project uses its own Artifactory binary repository, to distribute core, library, and plugin releases.
Only artifacts uploaded there can be considered released.
Plugins and libraries are not uploaded or mirrored to Maven Central.

Anyone has permission to view and download all (public) artifacts.
Permission to upload/deploy artifacts is controlled via link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater/[YAML files in a jenkins-infra GitHub repository].

[NOTE]
Permission to delete artifacts is not granted to anyone but administrators.
For instructions how to remove individual plugin releases or entire plugins from distribution, see link:../removing-from-distribution[Removing from Distribution], but note that this will not prevent anyone from directly downloading the artifacts from Artifactory.
