This page documents managing permissions for plugin maintainers.
There are 2 main permissions available to plugin contributors:

* GitHub permissions. 
  It includes merging pull requests, push to the repositories, managing GitHub applications, etc.
  The effective list of permissions depends on the link:https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization[permission levels], see below.
* Release Permissions which are needed to deploy releases to the link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/webapp/#/home[Jenkins artifact repository].
  Snapshots can be deployed by contributors without this permission.

NOTE: If you want to adopt a plugin, please see link:../adopt-a-plugin[Adopt a Plugin] instead.

== GitHub Permissions

GitHub permissions in Jenkins are managed by GitHub teams.
Almost every plugin has a `${plugin-id} Developers` team created specifically for this plugin.
This team may have a different link:https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization[permission level] depending on time of creation.
For all new repositories we tend to grant `Admin` permissions at the moment, and other plugin teams can get permissions elevated upon a request.

How to request GitHub permissions?
You will need to send a permission transfer request and to specify the permission recipient's GitHub account and Jenkins LDAP(aka Jenkins Jira) account there.

* Request permissions change in Jenkins Jira
** Project: `INFRA`, Component: `github`
* Request permissions in the Jenkins developer mailing list. 

Permission change requests should be ideally done by one of the active plugin maintainers.
Otherwise, an explicit approval will be required before the permission transfer happens.
If there are multiple active maintainers in a plugin, Jenkins GitHub administrators will usually wait for a while to collect approvals from a number of them.

=== Valid approvals by maintainers

The following ways of approval are generally recognized as valid ones:

* Confirmation in a Jenkins Jira ticket (permission request or other ticket)
* Explicit approval in a GitHub pull request or issue
** The reply should be sent from a GitHub account associated with a maintainer's Jenkins LDAP account
* Confirmation in the developer mailing list.
** The reply should be sent from the email listed in the Jenkins LDAP account

Other types of approval (emails from different addresses, email forwards by requesters, etc.) will be reviewed and verified by `jenkinsci` GitHub administrators.

== Release Permissions

Permissions to upload plugin releases are independent of GitHub push access and maintained in the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater[Repository Permissions Updater] repository.

To request upload permissions for a new maintainer:

. If you have never done it before, 
  you log in at least in once with your Jenkins account into the link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/webapp/#/home[Jenkins artifact repository].
  Any modification to the permission files will be ineffective until then.
. File a PR on that repository in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater[Repository Permissions Updater] as described in the README of that repository. Without this, you'll be unable to release your plugin.

//TODO(oleg-nenashev): Add CoC violations and so on?

By default we *DO NOT* remove upload permissions for current or past maintainers.
It can be done based on the explicit approval of the previous maintainer or based on the discussion in the Developer mailing list.
