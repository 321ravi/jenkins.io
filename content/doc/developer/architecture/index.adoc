The audience is Java developers familiar with Jenkins (as users) who want to understand how Jenkins works internally.

== Dataflow diagram

This dataflow represent Jenkins as a "box" and the goal is to have a view on network flow that goes in and out.

This diagram is a high level view centered on Jenkins Core.

Please note that:

- some plugins sur as the LDAP plugin can contribute to add new network flow.
- All port number can be changed by configuration, the port displayed is the default port.
- Jenkins can be configured to use TLS (HTTPS).
- It's not mandatory to have all agent types, there is one instance of each agent to illustrate communication types.
