= Getting Started with Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and
integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. Pipeline provides an
extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as
code" via the Pipeline DSL.
footnoteref:[dsl,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[Domain-Specific Language]]

This section introduces some of the key concepts to Jenkins Pipeline and
help introduce the basics of defining and working with Pipelines inside of a
running Jenkins instance.


== Prerequisites

To use Jenkins Pipeline, you will need:

* Jenkins 2.x or later (older versions back to 1.642.3 may work but are not
  recommended)
* Pipeline plugin
footnoteref:[pipeline,link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator[Pipeline plugin]]

Read more about how to install and manage plugins in
link:/doc/book/managing/plugins[Managing Plugins].


== Defining a Pipeline

Both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline is written in
link:http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] syntax. Relevant components of
link:http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html[Groovy syntax] will be introduced as
required throughout this documentation, so while an understanding of Groovy is
helpful, it is not required to work with Pipeline.

A basic Pipeline can be created in either of the following ways:

* Directly <<#using-blue-ocean,through Blue Ocean>> after setting up a Pipeline
  project.
* By <<#using-the-classic-ui,entering Pipeline code>> directly through the
  Jenkins classic UI.
* By <<#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm,creating a `Jenkinsfile`>> which can be
  checked into a project's source control repository.

The syntax for defining a Pipeline with either approach is the same, but while
Jenkins supports entering Pipeline directly into the classic UI, it is
generally considered best practice to define the Pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile`
which Jenkins will then load directly from source control.
footnoteref:[scm,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management[Source control management]]


=== Using Blue Ocean

If you are new to Jenkins Pipeline, the Blue Ocean UI helps you
link:/doc/book/blueocean/creating-pipelines[set up your Pipeline project], and
automatically creates and writes your Pipeline (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) for you
through the graphical Pipeline editor.

As part of setting up your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, Jenkins configures a
secure and appropriately authenticated connection to your project's source
control repository. Therefore, any changes you make to the `Jenkinsfile` via
Blue Ocean's Pipeline editor are automatically saved and committed to source
control.


=== Using the classic UI

`Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s created using the classic UI are stored by Jenkins itself
(within the Jenkins home directory).

To create a basic Pipeline using the Jenkins classic UI:

. If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins.
. From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI),
  click *New Item* at the top left.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/classic-ui-left-column.png[alt="Classic UI left column",width=30%]
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project. +
  *Caution:* Jenkins uses this item name to create directories on disk. It is
  recommended to avoid using spaces in item names, since doing so may uncover
  bugs in scripts that do not properly handle spaces in directory paths.
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page to
  open the Pipeline configuration page (whose *General* tab is selected).
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/new-item-creation.png[alt="Enter a name, click *Pipeline* and then click *OK*",width=100%]
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. In the *Pipeline* section, ensure that the *Definition* field indicates the
  *Pipeline script* option.
. Enter your Pipeline code into the *Script* text area. +
  For instance, copy the following Declarative example Pipeline code (below the
  _Jenkinsfile ( ... )_ heading) or its Scripted version equivalent and paste
  this into the *Script* text area. (The Declarative example below is used
  throughout the remainder of this procedure.)
+
[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any // <1>
    stages {
        stage('Stage 1') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello world!' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //
node { // <3>
    stage('Stage 1') {
        echo 'Hello World' // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> `agent` instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor (on any available
agent/node in the Jenkins environment) and workspace for the entire Pipeline.
<2> `echo` writes simple string in the console output.
<3> `node` effectively does the same as `agent` (above).
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/example-pipeline-in-classic-ui.png[alt="Example Pipeline in the classic UI",width=100%]
+
*Note:* You can also select from canned _Scripted_ Pipeline examples from the
*try sample Pipeline* option at the top right of the *Script* text area. Be
aware that there are no canned Declarative Pipeline examples available from this
field.
. Click *Save* to open the Pipeline project/item view page.
. On this page, click *Build Now* on the left to run the Pipeline.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/classic-ui-left-column-on-item.png[alt="Classic UI left column on an item",width=35%]
. Under *Build History* on the left, click *#1* to access the details for this
  particular Pipeline run.
. Click *Console Output* to see the full output from the Pipeline run. The
  following output shows a successful run of your Pipeline.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/hello-world-console-output.png[alt="*Console Output* for the Pipeline",width=70%]
+
*Notes:*

* You can also access the console output directly from the Dashboard by clicking
  the colored globe to the left of the build number (e.g. *#1*).
* Defining a Pipeline using the classic UI is convenient for testing out
  Pipeline code snippets, or for handling simple Pipelines or Pipelines that do
  not require source code to be checked out/cloned from a repository. As
  mentioned above, unlike `Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s you define through Blue Ocean
  (<<#using-blue-ocean,above>>) or in source control
  (<<#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm,below>>), `Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s entered into the
  *Script* text area area of Pipeline projects are stored by Jenkins itself,
  within the Jenkins home directory. Therefore, for greater control and
  flexibility over your Pipeline, particularly for projects in source control
  that are likely to gain complexity, it is recommended that you use
  <<#using-blue-ocean,Blue Ocean>> or
  <<#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm,source control>> to define your `Jenkinsfile`.

=== In SCM

Complex Pipelines are difficult to write and maintain within the
<<#using-the-classic-ui,classic UI's>> *Script* text area of the Pipeline
configuration page.

To make this easier, your Pipeline's `Jenkinsfile` can be written up in a text
editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and committed to source
control (optionally with the application code that Jenkins will build). Jenkins
can then check out your `Jenkinsfile` from source control as part of your
Pipeline project's build process and then proceed to execute your Pipeline.

To configure your Pipeline project to use a `Jenkinsfile` from source control:

. Follow the procedure above for defining your Pipeline
  <<#using-the-classic-ui,using the classic UI>> until you reach step 5
  (accessing the *Pipeline* section on the Pipeline configuration page).
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
. From the *SCM* field, choose the type of source control system of the
  repository containing your `Jenkinsfile`.
. Complete the fields specific to your repository's source control system. +
  *Tip:* If you are uncertain of what value to specify for a given field, click
  its *?* icon to the right for more information.
. In the *Script Path* field, specify the location (and name) of your
  `Jenkinsfile`. This location is the one that Jenkins checks out/clones the
  repository containing your `Jenkinsfile`, which should match that of the
  repository's file structure. The default value of this field assumes that your
  `Jenkinsfile` is named "Jenkinsfile" and is located at the root of the
  repository.

When you update the designated repository, a new build is triggered, as long as
the Pipeline is configured with an SCM polling trigger.

[TIP]
====
The first line of a `Jenkinsfile` should be `#!/usr/bin/env groovy`
footnoteref:[shebang,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashbang[Shebang (general definition)]]
footnoteref:[groovy_shebang,link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_shebang_line[Shebang line (Groovy syntax)]]
which text editors, IDEs, GitHub, etc will use to syntax highlight the
`Jenkinsfile` properly as Groovy code.

== Built-in Documentation

Pipeline ships with built-in documentation features to make it
easier to create Pipelines of varying complexities. This built-in documentation
is automatically generated and updated based on the plugins installed in the
Jenkins instance.

The built-in documentation can be found globally at:
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/],
assuming you have a Jenkins instance running on localhost port 8080. The same
documentation is also linked as *Pipeline Syntax* in the side-bar for any
configured Pipeline project.

[[snippet-generator]]
=== Snippet Generator

The built-in "Snippet Generator" utility is helpful for creating bits of
code for individual steps, discovering new steps provided by plugins, or
experimenting with different parameters for a particular step.

The Snippet Generator is dynamically populated with a list of the steps
available to the Jenkins instance. The number of steps available is dependent
on the plugins installed which explicitly expose steps for use in Pipeline.

To generate a step snippet with the Snippet Generator:

. Navigate to the *Pipeline Syntax* link (referenced above) from a configured Pipeline, or at link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax].
. Select the desired step in the *Sample Step* dropdown menu
. Use the dynamically populated area below the *Sample Step* dropdown to configure the selected step.
. Click *Generate Pipeline Script* to create a snippet of Pipeline which can be
copied and pasted into a Pipeline.


////
XXX: The above contains a reference to "Generate Pipeline Script" button which
needs to be renamed in a future release of Pipeline:
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40550
////

To access additional information and/or documentation about the step selected,
click on the help icon (indicated by the red arrow in the image above).

=== Global Variable Reference

In addition to the Snippet Generator, which only surfaces steps, Pipeline also
provides a built-in "*Global Variable Reference*." Like the Snippet Generator,
it is also dynamically populated by plugins. Unlike the Snippet Generator
however, the Global Variable Reference only contains documentation for
*variables* provided by Pipeline or plugins, which are available for
Pipelines.

The variables provided by default in Pipeline are:

env::

Environment variables accessible from Scripted Pipeline, for example:
`env.PATH` or `env.BUILD_ID`. Consult the built-in
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#env[Global Variable Reference]
for a complete, and up to date, list of environment variables
available in Pipeline.

params::

Exposes all parameters defined for the Pipeline as a read-only
link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_maps[Map],
for example: `params.MY_PARAM_NAME`.

currentBuild::

May be used to discover information about the currently executing Pipeline,
with properties such as `currentBuild.result`, `currentBuild.displayName`,
etc. Consult the built-in
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#currentBuild[Global Variable Reference]
for a complete, and up to date, list of properties available on `currentBuild`.


== Further Reading

This section merely scratches the surface of what can be done with Jenkins
Pipeline, but should provide enough of a foundation for you to start
experimenting with a test Jenkins instance.

In the next section, <<jenkinsfile#, The Jenkinsfile>>, more Pipeline steps
will be discussed along with patterns for implementing successful, real-world,
Jenkins Pipelines.
