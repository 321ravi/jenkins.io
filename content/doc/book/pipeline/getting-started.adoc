= Getting Started with Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and
integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. Pipeline provides an
extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as
code" via the Pipeline DSL.
footnoteref:[dsl,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[Domain-Specific Language]]

This section introduces some of the key concepts to Jenkins Pipeline and
help introduce the basics of defining and working with Pipelines inside of a
running Jenkins instance.


== Prerequisites

To use Jenkins Pipeline, you will need:

* Jenkins 2.x or later (older versions back to 1.642.3 may work but are not
  recommended)
* Pipeline plugin
footnoteref:[pipeline,link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator[Pipeline plugin]]

Read more about how to install and manage plugins in
link:/doc/book/managing/plugins[Managing Plugins].


== Defining a Pipeline

Both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline is written in
link:http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] syntax.

The relevant components of link:http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html[Groovy
syntax] will be introduced as necessary in this document, so while an
understanding of Groovy is helpful, it is not required to work with Pipeline.

A basic Pipeline can be created in either of the following ways:

* Directly <<#defining-a-pipeline-using-blue-ocean,through Blue Ocean>> after
  setting up a Pipeline project.
* By <<#defining-a-pipeline-using-the-classic-ui,entering Pipeline code>>
  directly through the Jenkins classic UI.
* By <<#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm,creating a `Jenkinsfile`>> which can be
  checked into a project's source control repository.

The syntax for defining a Pipeline with either approach is the same, but while
Jenkins supports entering Pipeline directly into the classic UI, it is
generally considered best practice to define the Pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile`
which Jenkins will then load directly from source control.
footnoteref:[scm,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management[Source control management]]


=== Defining a Pipeline using Blue Ocean

If you are new to Jenkins Pipeline, the Blue Ocean UI helps you
link:/doc/book/blueocean/creating-pipelines[set up your Pipeline project] and
creates your Pipeline (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) for you through the graphical
Pipeline editor.

As part of setting up your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, Jenkins configures a
secure and appropriately authenticated connection to your project's source
control repository. Therefore, any changes you make to the `Jenkinsfile` via
Blue Ocean's Pipeline editor are automatically saved and committed to source
control.


=== Defining a Pipeline using the classic UI

`Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s created using the classic UI are stored by Jenkins itself
(within the Jenkins home directory).

To create a basic Pipeline using the Jenkins classic UI:

. If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins.
. From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI),
  click *New Item* at the top left.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/classic-ui-left-column.png[alt="Classic UI left column",width=25%]
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project. +
  *Caution:* Jenkins uses this item name to create directories on disk. It is
  recommended to avoid using spaces in item names, since doing so may uncover
  bugs in scripts that do not properly handle spaces in directory paths.
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/new-item-creation.png[alt="Enter a name, click *Pipeline* and then click *OK*",width=100%]
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. Ensure that the *Definition* field indicates the *Pipeline script* option.
. In the *Script* text area, enter your Pipeline code and click *Save*. +
  For instance, copy the Declarative example Pipeline code (below the
  _Jenkinsfile ( ... )_ heading) or its Scripted version equivalent and paste
  this into the *Script* text area:
+
[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any // <1>
    stages {
        stage('Stage 1') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello world!' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //
node { // <3>
    stage('Stage 1') {
        echo 'Hello World' // <2>
    }
}
----
<1> `agent` instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor (on any available
agent/node in the Jenkins environment) and workspace for the entire Pipeline.
<2> `echo` writes simple string in the console output.
<3> `node` effectively does the same as `agent` (above).
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/example-pipeline-in-classic-ui.png[alt="Example Pipeline in the classic UI",width=100%]
+
*Note:* You can also select from canned _Scripted_ Pipeline examples from the *try
sample Pipeline* option at the top right of the *Script* text area. Be aware
that there are no canned Declarative Pipeline examples available from this
field.
. Back on the Dashboard, click *Build Now* on the left to run the Pipeline.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/classic-ui-left-column-on-item.png[alt="Classic UI left column on an item",width=30%]
. Click *#1* under *Build History* on the left and then click *Console Output*
  to see the full output from the Pipeline. The following output shows a
  successful run of your Pipeline.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:pipeline/hello-world-console-output.png[alt="*Console Output* for the Pipeline",width=70%]
+
*Notes:*

* You can also access the console output directly from the Dashboard by clicking
  the colored globe to the left of the build number (e.g. *#1*).
* As mentioned above, unlike `Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s you define through Blue Ocean
  (<<#defining-a-pipeline-using-blue-ocean,above>>) or in source control
  (<<#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm,below>>) the `Jenkinsfile` you entered into the
  *Script* text area (above) is stored by Jenkins itself (within the Jenkins
  home directory). Therefore, for greater control and flexibility over your
  Pipeline, particularly for projects in source control that are likely to gain
  complexity, it is recommended that you use
  <<#defining-a-pipeline-using-blue-ocean,Blue Ocean>> or
  <<#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm,source control>> to define your `Jenkinsfile`.

=== Defining a Pipeline in SCM

Complex Pipelines are hard to write and maintain within the text area of the
Pipeline configuration page. To make this easier, Pipeline can also be written
in a text editor and checked into source control as a `Jenkinsfile` which
Jenkins can load via the *Pipeline Script from SCM* option.

To do this, select *Pipeline script from SCM* when defining the Pipeline.

With the *Pipeline script from SCM* option selected, you do not enter any Groovy
code in the Jenkins UI; you just indicate by specifying a path where in source
code you want to retrieve the pipeline from. When you update the designated
repository, a new build is triggered, as long as the Pipeline is configured with an
SCM polling trigger.

XXX: The above contains a reference to ""Pipeline script from SCM" dropdown
which needs to be renamed in a future release of Pipeline:
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40550
////

[TIP]
====
The first line of a `Jenkinsfile` should be `#!/usr/bin/env groovy`
footnoteref:[shebang,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashbang[Shebang (general definition)]]
footnoteref:[groovy_shebang,link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_shebang_line[Shebang line (Groovy syntax)]]
which text editors, IDEs, GitHub, etc will use to syntax highlight the
`Jenkinsfile` properly as Groovy code.

== Built-in Documentation

Pipeline ships with built-in documentation features to make it
easier to create Pipelines of varying complexities. This built-in documentation
is automatically generated and updated based on the plugins installed in the
Jenkins instance.

The built-in documentation can be found globally at:
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/],
assuming you have a Jenkins instance running on localhost port 8080. The same
documentation is also linked as *Pipeline Syntax* in the side-bar for any
configured Pipeline project.

image::pipeline/pipeline-syntax-sidebar.png[Pipeline Syntax in the side-bar, role=center]

[[snippet-generator]]
=== Snippet Generator

The built-in "Snippet Generator" utility is helpful for creating bits of
code for individual steps, discovering new steps provided by plugins, or
experimenting with different parameters for a particular step.

The Snippet Generator is dynamically populated with a list of the steps
available to the Jenkins instance. The number of steps available is dependent
on the plugins installed which explicitly expose steps for use in Pipeline.

To generate a step snippet with the Snippet Generator:

. Navigate to the *Pipeline Syntax* link (referenced above) from a configured Pipeline, or at link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax].
. Select the desired step in the *Sample Step* dropdown menu
. Use the dynamically populated area below the *Sample Step* dropdown to configure the selected step.
. Click *Generate Pipeline Script* to create a snippet of Pipeline which can be
copied and pasted into a Pipeline.


////
XXX: The above contains a reference to "Generate Pipeline Script" button which
needs to be renamed in a future release of Pipeline:
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40550
////

image::pipeline/snippet-generator.png[Snippet Generator, role=center]

To access additional information and/or documentation about the step selected,
click on the help icon (indicated by the red arrow in the image above).

=== Global Variable Reference

In addition to the Snippet Generator, which only surfaces steps, Pipeline also
provides a built-in "*Global Variable Reference*." Like the Snippet Generator,
it is also dynamically populated by plugins. Unlike the Snippet Generator
however, the Global Variable Reference only contains documentation for
*variables* provided by Pipeline or plugins, which are available for
Pipelines.

The variables provided by default in Pipeline are:

env::

Environment variables accessible from Scripted Pipeline, for example:
`env.PATH` or `env.BUILD_ID`. Consult the built-in
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#env[Global Variable Reference]
for a complete, and up to date, list of environment variables
available in Pipeline.

params::

Exposes all parameters defined for the Pipeline as a read-only
link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_maps[Map],
for example: `params.MY_PARAM_NAME`.

currentBuild::

May be used to discover information about the currently executing Pipeline,
with properties such as `currentBuild.result`, `currentBuild.displayName`,
etc. Consult the built-in
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#currentBuild[Global Variable Reference]
for a complete, and up to date, list of properties available on `currentBuild`.


== Further Reading

This section merely scratches the surface of what can be done with Jenkins
Pipeline, but should provide enough of a foundation for you to start
experimenting with a test Jenkins instance.

In the next section, <<jenkinsfile#, The Jenkinsfile>>, more Pipeline steps
will be discussed along with patterns for implementing successful, real-world,
Jenkins Pipelines.
