=== Run Jenkins in Docker

In this tutorial, you'll be running Jenkins as a Docker container from the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[`jenkinsci/blueocean`] Docker
image.

To run Jenkins in Docker, follow the relevant instructions below for either
<<on-macos-and-linux,macOS and Linux>> or <<on-windows,Windows>>.

You can read more about Docker container and image concepts in the
link:/doc/book/installing/#docker[Docker] and
link:/doc/book/installing/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker[Downloading
and running Jenkins in Docker] sections of the
link:/doc/book/installing/[Installing Jenkins] page.

==== On macOS and Linux

. Open up a terminal window.
. Run the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image as a container in Docker using the
  following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command (bearing in mind that this command automatically downloads the image
  if this hasn't been done):
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -u root \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ # <1>
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \ # <2>
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
<1> Maps the `/var/jenkins_home` directory in the container to the Docker
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/[volume] with the name
`jenkins-data`. If this volume does not exist, then this `docker run` command
will automatically create the volume for you.
<2> Maps the `$HOME` directory on the host (i.e. your local) machine (usually
the `/Users/<your-username>` directory) to the `/home` directory in the
container.
+
*Note:* If copying and pasting the command snippet above doesn't work, try
copying and pasting this annotation-free version here:
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -u root \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
. Proceed to the <<setup-wizard,Setup wizard>>.


==== On Windows

. Open up a command prompt window.
. Run the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image as a container in Docker using the
  following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command (bearing in mind that this command automatically downloads the image
  if this hasn't been done):
+
----
docker run ^
  --rm ^
  -u root ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  -v "%HOMEPATH%":/home ^
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
For an explanation of these options, refer to the <<on-macos-and-linux,macOS
and Linux>> instructions above.
. Proceed to the <<setup-wizard,Setup wizard>>.


==== Accessing the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container

If you have some experience with Docker and you wish or need to access the
Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container through a terminal/command prompt using the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/[`docker exec`]
command, you can add an option like `--name jenkins-tutorials` (with the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
above), which would give the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container the name
"jenkins-tutorials".

This means you could access the Jenkins/Blue Ocean container (through a separate
terminal/command prompt window) with a `docker exec` command like:

`docker exec -it jenkins-tutorials bash`


==== Setup wizard

Before you can access Jenkins, there are a few quick "one-off" steps you'll need
to perform.


===== Unlocking Jenkins

When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using
an automatically-generated password.

. After the 2 sets of asterisks appear in the terminal/command prompt window,
  browse to `http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-01-unlock-jenkins-page.jpg[alt="Unlock Jenkins
page",width=100%]
. From your terminal/command prompt window again, copy the
  automatically-generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of
  asterisks).
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-02-copying-initial-admin-password.png[alt="Copying
initial admin password",width=100%]
. On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password into the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*.


===== Customizing Jenkins with plugins

After <<unlocking-jenkins,unlocking Jenkins>>, the *Customize Jenkins* page
appears.

On this page, click *Install suggested plugins*.

The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and the
suggested plugins being installed. This process may take a few minutes.


===== Creating the first administrator user

Finally, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

. When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify your details in the
  respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
. When the *Jenkins is ready* page appears, click *Start using Jenkins*. +
  *Notes:*
* This page may indicate *Jenkins is almost ready!* instead and if so, click
  *Restart*.
* If the page doesn't automatically refresh after a minute, use your web browser
  to refresh the page manually.
. If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just
  created and you're ready to start using Jenkins!


==== Stopping and restarting Jenkins

Throughout the remainder of this tutorial, you can stop the Jenkins/Blue Ocean
Docker container by typing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal/command prompt window from
which you ran the `docker run ...` command <<run-jenkins-in-docker,above>>.

To restart the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container:

. Run the same `docker run ...` command you ran for <<on-macos-and-linux,macOS,
  Linux>> or <<on-windows,Windows>> above. +
  *Note:* This process also updates the `jenkinsci/blueocean` Docker image, if
  an updated one is available.
. Browse to `http://localhost:8080`.
. Wait until the log in page appears and log in.
