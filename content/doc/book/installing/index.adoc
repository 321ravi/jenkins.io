The procedures on this page are for new installations of Jenkins on a
single/local machine.

Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process with the
built-in

(link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty]).

Jenkins can also be run as a servlet in different Java servlet containers such
as link:https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] or
link:https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/[GlassFish]. However, instructions for
setting up these types of installations are beyond the scope of this chapter.

*Note:* Although this chapter focuses on local installations of Jenkins, this
content can also be used to help set up Jenkins in production environments.
