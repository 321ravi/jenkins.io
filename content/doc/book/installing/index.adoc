= Installing Jenkins

The procedures on this page are for new installations of Jenkins on a
single/local machine.

Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process with the
built-in
link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7213541/what-is-java-servlet[Java
servlet] container/application server
(link:http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty]).

Jenkins can also be run as a servlet in different Java servlet containers such
as link:http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] or
link:https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/[GlassFish]. However, instructions for
setting up these types of installations are beyond the scope of this page.

*Note:* Although this page focusses on local installations of Jenkins, this
content can also be used to help set up Jenkins in production environments.


== Prerequisites

Minimum hardware requirements:

* 256 MB of RAM
* 1 GB of drive space (although 10 GB is a recommended minimum if running
  Jenkins as a <<docker,Docker>> container)

Recommended hardware configuration for a small team:

* 1 GB+ of RAM
* 50 GB+ of drive space

Sofware requirements:

* Java 8 - either a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java Development Kit
  (JDK) is fine +
  *Note:* This is not a requirement if running Jenkins as a <<docker,Docker>>
  container.


== Installation platforms

This section describes how to install/run Jenkins on different platforms and
operating systems.


=== Docker

link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker] is a platform for
running applications in an isolated environment called a "container" (or Docker
container). Applications like Jenkins can be downloaded as read-only "images"
(or Docker images), each of which is run in Docker as a container. A Docker
container is in effect a "running instance" of a Docker image. From this
perspective, an image is stored permanently more or less (i.e. insofar as image
updates are published), whereas containers are stored temporarily. Read more
about these concepts in the Docker documentation's
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Getting Started, Part 1: Orientation and
setup] page.

Docker's fundamental platform and container design means that a single Docker
image (for any given application like Jenkins) can be run on any operating
system (e.g. macOS, Linux and Windows) which is also running Docker.


==== Installing Docker

To install Docker on your operating system, visit the
link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] website and navigate to *Get Docker* at the
top of their site to begin accessing the Docker download that is suitable for
your operating system. Follow the installation instructions on their website.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are installing Docker on a Linux-based operating system, ensure
you configure Docker so it can be managed as a non-root user. Read more about
this in Docker's
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/[Post-installation
steps for Linux] page of their documentation. This page also contains
information about how to configure Docker to start on boot.
====

==== Downloading and running Jenkins in Docker

There are several Docker images of Jenkins available.

The recommended Docker image to use is the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[`jenkinsci/blueocean` image]
(from the link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub repository]). This image
contains the current link:/download[Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Jenkins]
(which is production-ready) bundled with all Blue Ocean plugins and features.
This means that you do not need to install the Blue Ocean plugins separately.

[NOTE]
====
A new `jenkinsci/blueocean` image is published each time a new release of Blue
Ocean is published. You can see a list of previously published versions of the
`jenkinsci/blueocean` image on the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/tags/[tags] page.

There are also other Jenkins Docker images you can use (accessible through
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/[`jenkins/jenkins`] on Docker
Hub). However, these do not come with Blue Ocean, which would need to be
installed via the link:../../book/managing[**Manage Jenkins**] >
link:../../book/managing/plugins/[**Manage Plugins**] page in Jenkins. Read more
about this in link:../../book/blueocean/getting-started[Getting started with
Blue Ocean].
====


===== On macOS and Linux

. Open up a terminal window.
. Download the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image and run it as a container in Docker
  using the following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
  --rm \  # <1>
  -d \ # <2>
  -p 8080:8080 \ # <3>
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ # <4>
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  jenkinsci/blueocean # <5>
----
<1> ( _Optional_ ) Automatically removes the Docker container (which is the
instantiation of the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image below) when it is shut down.
This keeps things tidy if you need to quit Jenkins.
<2> ( _Optional_ ) Runs the `jenkinsci/blueocean` container in the background
(i.e. "detached" mode) and outputs the container ID. If you do not specify this
option, then the running Docker log for this container is output in the terminal
window.
<3> Makes (i.e. "publishes") port 8080 of the `jenkinsci/blueocean` container to
port 8080 on the host machine. The 1st number represents the port on the host
while the 2nd represents the container's port. Therefore, if you specified `-p
49001:8080` for this option, you would be accessing Jenkins on your host machine
through port 49001.
<4> Maps the `/var/jenkins_home` directory in the container to the Docker
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/[volume] with the name
`jenkins-data`. If this volume does not exist, then this `docker run` command
will automatically create the volume for you. +
*Notes:*
This volume could also be created independently using the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/[`docker
volume create`] command: +
`docker volume create jenkins-data` +
Instead of mapping the `/var/jenkins_home` directory to a Docker volume, you
could also map this directory to one on your machine's local file system. For
example, specifying the option +
`-v $HOME/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home` would map the container's
`/var/jenkins_home` directory to the `jenkins` subdirectory within the `$HOME`
directory on your local machine, which would typically be
`/Users/<your-username>/jenkins` or `/home/<your-username>/jenkins`.
<6> The `jenkinsci/blueocean` Docker image itself. If this image has not already
been downloaded, then this `docker run` command will automtically download the
image for you. Furthermore, if any updates to this image were published since
you last ran this command, then running this command again will automatically
download these published image updates for you. +
*Note:* This Docker image could also be downloaded (or updated) independently
using the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/[`docker
pull`] command: +
`docker pull jenkinsci/blueocean`
+
*Note:* If copying and pasting the command snippet above does not work, try
copying and pasting this annotation-free version here:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
. Proceed to the <<setupwizard,Post-installation setup wizard>>.


===== On Windows

. Open up a terminal window.
. Download the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image and run it as a container in Docker
  using the following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command:
+
[source]
----
docker run ^
  --rm ^
  -d ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
For an explanation of each of these options, refer to the <<on-macos-and-linux,
macOS and Linux>> instructions above.
. Proceed to the <<setupwizard,Post-installation setup wizard>>.


==== Accessing the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container

If you have some experience with Docker and you wish or need to access the
`jenkinsci/blueocean` container through a terminal/command prompt using the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/[`docker exec`]
command, you can add an option like `--name jenkins-blueocean` (with the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
above), which would give the `jenkinsci/blueocean` container the name
"jenkins-blueocean".

This means you could access the container (through a separate terminal/command
prompt window) with a `docker exec` command like:

`docker exec -it jenkins-blue bash`


==== Accessing the Jenkins console log through Docker logs

There is a possibility you may need to access the Jenkins console log, for
instance, when <<unlocking-jenkins,Unlocking Jenkins>> as part of the
<<setupwizard,Post-installation setup wizard>>.

If you did not specify the detached mode option `-d` with the `docker run ...`
command <<downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker,above>>, then the Jenkins
console log is easily accessible through the terminal/command prompt window from
which you ran this Docker command.

Otherwise, you can access the Jenkins console log through the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/[Docker logs] of
the `jenkinsci/blueocean` container using the following command:

`docker logs <docker-container-name>`

Your `<docker-container-name>` can be obtained using the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/[`docker ps`] command.
If you specified the +
`--name jenkins-blueocean` option in the `docker run ...` command above (see
also
<<accessing-the-jenkins-blue-ocean-docker-container,Accessing the Jenkins/Blue
Ocean Docker container>>), you can simply use the `docker logs` command:

`docker logs jenkins-blueocean`


==== Accessing the Jenkins home directory

There is a possibility you may need to access the Jenkins home directory, for
instance, to check the details of a Jenkins build in the `workspace`
subdirectory.

If you mapped the Jenkins home directory (`/var/jenkins_home`) to one on your
machine's local file system (i.e. in the `docker run ...` command
<<downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker,above>>), then you can access the
contents of this directory through your machine's usual terminal/command prompt.

Otherwise, if you specified the `-v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home` option in
the `docker run ...` command, you can access the contents of the Jenkins home
directory through the `jenkinsci/blueocean` container's terminal/command prompt
using the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/[`docker exec`]
command:

`docker exec -it <docker-container-name> bash`

As mentioned <<accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs,above>>,
your `<docker-container-name>` can be obtained using the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/[`docker ps`] command.
If you specified the +
`--name jenkins-blueocean` option in the `docker run ...`
command above (see also
<<accessing-the-jenkins-blue-ocean-docker-container,Accessing the Jenkins/Blue
Ocean Docker container>>), you can simply use the `docker exec` command:

`docker exec -it jenkins-blueocean bash`

////
Might wish to add explaining the `jenkins/jenkins` Docker image and the `docker
run -t` option. Both of these were covered in the old installation instructions
but not above.

Also mention that spinning up a container of the `jenkinsci/blueocean` Docker
image can be done so with all the same
https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#usage[configuration options] available to
the other images published by the Jenkins project.

Explaing difference between `docker run ...` on `jenkinsci/blueocean:latest'
and simply `jenkinsci/blueocean`.

=== WAR file

The Web application ARchive (WAR) file version of Jenkins can be installed on
any operating system or platform that supports Java.

*To download and run the WAR file version of Jenkins:*

. Download the http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest
  stable Jenkins WAR file] to an appropriate directory on your machine.
. Open up a terminal/command prompt window to the download directory.
. Run the command `java -jar jenkins.war`.
. Browse to `http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears.
. Continue on with the <<setupwizard,Post-installation setup wizard>> below.

*Notes:*

* Unlike downloading and running Jenkins with Blue Ocean in Docker
  (<<docker,above>>), this process does not automatically install the Blue Ocean
  features, which would need to installed separately via the
  link:../../book/managing[**Manage Jenkins**] >
  link:../../book/managing/plugins/[**Manage Plugins**] page in Jenkins. Read
  more about the specifics for installing Blue Ocean on the
  link:../../book/blueocean/getting-started/[Getting Started with Blue Ocean]
  page.
* You can change the port by specifying the `--httpPort` option when you run the
  `java -jar jenkins.war` command. For example, to make Jenkins accessible
  through port 49001, then run Jenkins using the command: +
  `java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=49001`


=== macOS

To install from the website, using a package:

* link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/osx/latest[Download the latest package]
* Open the package and follow the instructions

Jenkins can also be installed using `brew`:

* Install the latest release version
[source,bash]
----
brew install jenkins
----

* Install the LTS version
[source,bash]
----
brew install jenkins-lts
----


=== Linux

==== Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, you can install Jenkins through `apt`.

Recent versions are available in link:https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/[an apt repository]. Older but stable LTS versions are in link:https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/[this apt repository].

[source,bash]
----
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
----

This package installation will:

* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. See `/etc/init.d/jenkins` for more details.
* Create a '`jenkins`' user to run this service.
* Direct console log output to the file `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
* Populate `/etc/default/jenkins` with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g `JENKINS_HOME`
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If your `/etc/init.d/jenkins` file fails to start Jenkins, edit the `/etc/default/jenkins` to replace the line
`----HTTP_PORT=8080----` with `----HTTP_PORT=8081----`
Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.
====


=== Windows

To install from the website, using the installer:

* link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/windows/latest[Download the latest package]
* Open the package and follow the instructions


=== Other operating systems


==== OpenIndiana Hipster

On a system running link:http://www.openindiana.org/[OpenIndiana Hipster]
Jenkins can be installed in either the local or global zone using the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Packaging_System[Image Packaging
System] (IPS).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disclaimer: This platform is NOT officially supported by the Jenkins team,
use it at your own risk. Packaging and integration described in this section
is maintained by the OpenIndiana Hipster team, bundling the generic `jenkins.war`
to work in that operating environment.
====

For the common case of running the newest packaged weekly build as a standalone (Jetty) server, simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
pkg install jenkins
svcadm enable jenkins
----

The common packaging integration for a standalone service will:

* Create a `jenkins` user to run the service and to own the directory structures under `/var/lib/jenkins`.
* Pull the OpenJDK8 and other packages required to execute Jenkins, including
  the `jenkins-core-weekly` package with the latest `jenkins.war`.
+
CAUTION: Long-Term Support (LTS) Jenkins releases currently do not support OpenZFS-based
systems, so no packaging is provided at this time.
* Set up Jenkins as an SMF service instance (`svc:/network/http:jenkins`) which
  can then be enabled with the `svcadm` command demonstrated above.
* Set up Jenkins to listen on port 8080.
* Configure the log output to be managed by SMF at `/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`.

Once Jenkins is running, consult the log
(`/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`) to retrieve the generated
administrator password for the initial set up of Jenkins, usually it will be
found at `/var/lib/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`. Then navigate to
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] to <<setupwizard, complete configuration of the
Jenkins instance>>.


To change attributes of the service, such as environment variables like `JENKINS_HOME`
or the port number used for the Jetty web server, use the `svccfg` utility:

[source,bash]
----
svccfg -s svc:/network/http:jenkins editprop
svcadm refresh svc:/network/http:jenkins
----

You can also refer to `/lib/svc/manifest/network/jenkins-standalone.xml` for more
details and comments about currently supported tunables of the SMF service.
Note that the `jenkins` user account created by the packaging is specially privileged
to allow binding to port numbers under 1024.

The current status of Jenkins-related packages available for the given release
of OpenIndiana can be queried with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg info -r '*jenkins*'
----

Upgrades to the package can be performed by updating the entire operating
environment with `pkg update`, or specifically for Jenkins core software with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg update jenkins-core-weekly
----

[CAUTION]
====
Procedure for updating the package will restart the currently running Jenkins
process. Make sure to prepare it for shutdown and finish all running jobs
before updating, if needed.
====



==== Solaris, OmniOS, SmartOS, and other siblings

Generally it should suffice to install Java 8 and link:/download[download] the
`jenkins.war` and run it as a standalone process or under an application server
such as link:http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat].


Some caveats apply:

* Headless JVM and fonts: For OpenJDK builds on minimalized-footprint systems,
  there may be
  link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+got+java.awt.headless+problem[issues
  running the headless JVM], because Jenkins needs some fonts to render certain
  pages.
* ZFS-related JVM crashes: When Jenkins runs on a system detected as a `SunOS`,
  it tries to load integration for advanced ZFS features using the bundled
  `libzfs.jar` which maps calls from Java to native `libzfs.so` routines
  provided by the host OS. Unfortunately, that library was made for binary
  utilities built and bundled by the OS along with it at the same time, and was
  never intended as a stable interface exposed to consumers. As the forks of
  Solaris legacy, including ZFS and later the OpenZFS initiative evolved, many
  different binary function signatures were provided by different host
  operating systems - and when Jenkins `libzfs.jar` invoked the wrong
  signature, the whole JVM process crashed. A solution was proposed and
  integrated in `jenkins.war` since weekly release 2.55 (and not yet in any LTS
  to date) which enables the administrator to configure which function
  signatures should be used for each function known to have different variants,
  apply it to their application server initialization options and then run and
  update the generic `jenkins.war` without further workarounds. See
  link:https://github.com/kohsuke/libzfs4j[the libzfs4j Git repository] for
  more details, including a script to try and "lock-pick" the configuration
  needed for your particular distribution (in particular if your kernel updates
  bring a new incompatible `libzfs.so`).

Also note that forks of the OpenZFS initiative may provide ZFS on various
BSD, Linux, and macOS distributions. Once Jenkins supports detecting ZFS
capabilities, rather than relying on the `SunOS` check, the above caveats for
ZFS integration with Jenkins should be considered.


[[setupwizard]]
== Post-installation setup wizard

After downloading, installing and running Jenkins using one of the procedures
above, the post-installation setup wizard begins.

This setup wizard takes you through are a few quick "one-off" steps to unlock
Jenkins, customize it with plugins and create the first administrator user
through which you can continue accessing Jenkins.


=== Unlocking Jenkins

When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using
an automatically-generated password.

. Browse to `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever port you configured for
  Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page appears.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-01-unlock-jenkins-page.jpg[alt="Unlock Jenkins
page",width=100%]
. From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically-generated
  alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of asterisks).
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-02-copying-initial-admin-password.png[alt="Copying
initial admin password",width=100%] +
. On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password into the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*. +
  *Notes:*
* If you ran Jenkins in Docker in detached mode, you can access the Jenkins
  console log from the Docker logs
  (<<accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs,above>>).
* The Jenkins console log indicates the location (in the Jenkins home directory)
  where this password can also be obtained. This password must be entered in the
  setup wizard on new Jenkins installations before you can access Jenkins's main
  UI. This password also serves as the default admininstrator account's password
  (with username "admin") if you happen to skip the subsequent user-creation
  step in the setup wizard.


=== Customizing Jenkins with plugins

After <<unlocking-jenkins,unlocking Jenkins>>, the *Customize Jenkins* page
appears. Here you can install any number of useful plugins as part of your
initial setup.

Click one of the two options shown:

* *Install suggested plugins* - to install the recommended set of plugins, which
   are based on most common use cases.
* *Select plugins to install* - to choose which set of plugins to initially
   install. When you first access the plugin selection page, the suggested
   plugins are selected by default.

NOTE: If you are not sure what plugins you need, choose **Install suggested
plugins**.
You can install (or remove) additional Jenkins plugins at a later point in time
via the
link:../../book/managing[**Manage Jenkins**] >
link:../../book/managing/plugins/[**Manage Plugins**] page in Jenkins.

The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and your
chosen set of Jenkins plugins being installed. This process may take a few
minutes.


=== Creating the first administrator user

Finally, after <<customizing-jenkins-with-plugins,customizing Jenkins with
plugins>>, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

. When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify the details for your
  administrator user in the respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
. When the *Jenkins is ready* page appears, click *Start using Jenkins*. +
  *Notes:*
* This page may indicate *Jenkins is almost ready!* instead and if so, click
  *Restart*.
* If the page does not automatically refresh after a minute, use your web
  browser to refresh the page manually.
. If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just
  created and you are ready to start using Jenkins!

IMPORTANT: From this point on, the Jenkins UI is only accessible by providing
valid username and password credentials.
