= Create a Pipeline project

Blue Ocean makes it easy to create a Pipeline project in Jenkins.

A Pipeline project's Pipeline can be generated from an existing `Jenkinsfile` in
source control, or you can use the <<pipeline-editor#,Blue Ocean Pipeline
editor>> to create a new Pipeline for you (as a `Jenkinsfile` that will be
committed to source control).


== Set up your Pipeline project

To start setting up your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, at the top-right of the
<<dashboard#,Blue Ocean Dashboard>>, click the *New Pipeline* button.

Button',width=50%]

On a new Jenkins instance or if Jenkins has no existing jobs or Pipelines and
the Dashboard is empty, Blue Ocean will also display a message box on which you
can click the *Create a New Pipeline* button to start setting up your
Pipeline project.

Jenkins - Create a New Pipeline message box',width=50%]


=== From a Git repository

To create your Pipeline project from a Git repository, click the *Git* button
under *Where do you store your code?*

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/where-do-you-store-your-code.png['Where do
you store your code',width=70%]

In the *Connect to a Git repository* section, enter the URL for your Git
repository in the *Repository URL* field.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/connect-to-a-git-repository.png['Connect to a
Git repository',width=70%]

You now need to specify a <<local-repositories,local>> or a
<<remote-repositories,remote>> repository from which to build your Pipeline
project.


==== Local repositories

If your URL is a local directory path (e.g. beginning with a forward slash `/`
such as `/home/cloned-git-repositories/my-git-repository.git`), you can proceed
to click the *Create Pipeline* button.

Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`. If
Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin creating
one through the <<pipeline-editor#,Blue Ocean Pipeline editor>>.


==== Remote repositories

If your URL is for a remote Git repository, then as soon as you begin typing
the URL, starting with either:

* `ssh://` - e.g.
  `ssh://gituser@server-url/git-server-repositories/my-git-repository.git` +
  or
* `user@host:path/to/git/repo.git` - e.g.
  `gituser@server-url:git-server-repositories/my-git-repository.git`,

Blue Ocean provides you with its own public SSH key for your current/logged in
Jenkins user.

. Ensure that this public SSH key (which you can copy and paste from the Blue
  Ocean interface) has been configured for the remote Git server's user account
  (e.g. within the `authorized_keys` file of the machine's `gituser/.ssh`
  directory) before continuing. +
  *Note:* This process allows your Jenkins user account to access the
  repositories that your Git server's user account (e.g. `gituser`) has access
  to. Read more about this in
  link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server[Setting
  Up the Server] of the link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/[Pro Git documentation].
. When done, return to the Blue Ocean interface and click the *Create Pipeline*
  button.

Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`. If
Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin creating
one through the <<pipeline-editor#,Blue Ocean Pipeline editor>>.

[WARNING]
====
Since the Blue Ocean Pipeline editor saves edited Pipelines to Git repositories
as `Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s, Blue Ocean does not support other Git connection protocols
like HTTP or HTTPS. Therefore, you will need to configure Blue Ocean's public
SSH key with your Git server instead (as described
<<remote-repositories,above>>), or by using one of the other hosted Git server
options documented on this page.
====

[NOTE]
====
When Blue Ocean generates its own public SSH key for your current/logged in
Jenkins user, Jenkins registers this credential with the following details for
this Jenkins user:

* *Domain*: `blueocean-private-key-domain`
* *ID*: `jenkins-generated-ssh-key`
* *Name*: `<jenkins-username> (jenkins-generated-ssh-key)`
====


=== From a repository on GitHub

To create your Pipeline project directly from a repository on GitHub, click the
*GitHub* button under *Where do you store your code?*

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/where-do-you-store-your-code.png['Where do
you store your code',width=70%]

In the *Connect to GitHub* section, enter your GitHub access token into the
*Your GitHub access token* field. +
If you previously configured Blue Ocean to connect to GitHub using a personal
access token, Blue Ocean takes you directly to the
<<choose-your-github-account-organization-and-repository,choosing your GitHub
account/organization and repository>> steps below.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/connect-to-github.png['Connect to
GitHub',width=70%]

If you do not have a GitHub access token, click the *Create an access key here*
link to open GitHub to the *<<create-your-access-token,New personal access
token>>* page.


==== Create your access token

. In the new tab, sign in to your GitHub account (if necessary) and on the
  GitHub *New Personal Access Token* page, specify a brief *Token description*
  for your GitHub access token (e.g. `Blue Ocean`). +
  *Note:* An access token is usually an alphanumeric string that respresents
  your GitHub account along with permissions to access various GitHub features
  and areas through your GitHub account. The new access token process (triggered
  through the *Create an access key here* link above) has the appropriate
  permissions pre-selected, which Blue Ocean requires to access and interact
  with your GitHub account.
. Scroll down to the end of the page (optionally selecting additional scopes you
  may require) and click *Generate token*.
. On the resulting *Personal access tokens* page, copy your newly generated
  access token.
. Back in Blue Ocean, paste the access token into the *Your GitHub access token*
  field and click *Connect*. +
  Your current/logged in Jenkins user now has access to your GitHub account
  (provided by your access token), so you can now
  <<choose-your-github-account-organization-and-repository,choose your GitHub
  account/organization and repository>>.


==== Choose your GitHub account/organization and repository

At this point, Blue Ocean prompts you to choose your GitHub account or an
organization you are a member of, as well as the repository it contains from
which to build your Pipeline project.

. In the *Which organization does the repository belong to?* section, click
  either:
  * Your GitHub account to create a Pipeline project for one of your own GitHub
    repositories or one which you have forked from elsewhere on GitHub.
  * An organization you are a member of to create a Pipeline project for a
    GitHub repository located within this organization.
. In the *Choose a repository* section, click the repository (within your GitHub
  account or organization) from which to build your Pipeline project. +
  *Tip:* If your list of repositories is long, you can filter this list using
  the *Search* option.
[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/choose-a-repository.png['Choose a
repository',width=70%]
. Click *Create Pipeline*. +
  Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
  and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`.
  If Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin
  creating one through the <<pipeline-editor#,Blue Ocean Pipeline editor>> (by
  clicking *Create Pipeline* again). +
  *Note:* Under the hood, a Pipeline project created through Blue Ocean is
  actually "multibranch Pipeline". Therefore, Jenkins looks for the presence of
  at least one Jenkinsfile in any branch of your repository.

[NOTE]
====
When you register the Github access token for your current/logged in Jenkins
user in Blue Ocean, Jenkins registers this credential with the following details
for this Jenkins user:

* *Domain*: `blueocean-github-domain`
* *ID*: `github`
* *Name*: `<jenkins-username>/****** (GitHub Access Token)`

==== Choose your Bitbucket account/team and repository

At this point, Blue Ocean prompts you to choose your Bitbucket account or a team
you are a member of, as well as the repository it contains from which to build
your Pipeline project.

. In the *Which team does the repository belong to?* section, click either:
  * Your Bitbucket account to create a Pipeline project for one of your own
    Bitbucket repositories or one which you have forked from elsewhere on
    Bitbucket.
  * A team you are a member of to create a Pipeline project for a Bitbucket
    repository located within this team.
. In the *Choose a repository* section, click the repository (within your
  Bitbucket account or team) from which to build your Pipeline project. +
  *Tip:* If your list of repositories is long, you can filter this list using
  the *Search* option.
