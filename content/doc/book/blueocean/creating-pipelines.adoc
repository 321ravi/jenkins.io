= Create a Pipeline project

Blue Ocean makes it easy to create a Pipeline project in Jenkins.

A Pipeline project's Pipeline can be generated from an existing `Jenkinsfile` in
source control, or you can use Blue Ocean's <<pipeline-editor#, Pipeline
Editor>> to create a new Pipeline for you (as a `Jenkinsfile` that will be
committed to source control).


== Set up your Pipeline project

To start setting up your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, at the top-right of the
<<dashboard#,Blue Ocean Dashboard>>, click the *New Pipeline* button.

Button',width=50%]

On a new Jenkins instance or if Jenkins has no existing jobs or Pipelines and
the Dashboard is empty, Blue Ocean will also display a message box on which you
can click the *Create a New Pipeline* button to start setting up your
Pipeline project.

Jenkins - Create a New Pipeline message box',width=50%]


=== Create a Pipeline project from a Git repository

To create your Pipeline project from a Git repository, click the *Git* button
under *Where do you store your code?*

you store your code',width=70%]

In the *Connect to a Git repository* section, enter the URL for your Git
repository in the *Repository URL* field.

Git repository',width=70%]

If your URL is a local directory path, you can proceed to click the *Create
Pipeline* button and Jenkins will scan your repository's branches for a
`Jenkinsfile`. If Jenkins cannot find one, Blue Ocean will then prompt you to
begin creating a Pipeline.

If your URL is for a remote Git repository (e.g. )

When done, click "Create Pipeline".
Blue ocean will look at all branches for the selected repository,
and will start a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`.


=== Creating Pipelines for GitHub Repositories

To create a Pipeline from a GitHub,
start by selecting *GitHub* as the Source Control system.

==== Provide a GitHub Access Token

If this is the first time Pipeline Creation has been run by the currently logged in user,
Blue Ocean will ask for a
link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/[GitHub Access Token]
to allow Blue Ocean to access your organizations and repositories.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/connect-to-github.png['Configure a GitHub
Access Token for Jenkins',width=60%]

If you have not already created a access token, click on the link provided and
Blue Ocean will navigate to
link:https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[the right page on GitHub],
automatically selecting the appropriate permissions it will need.

==== Select a GitHub Account or Organization

All repositories on Github are grouped by owner, either an account or organization.
When creating Pipelines, Blue Ocean mirrors that structure,
asking users to select an account or organization which owns the repositories
from which it will add Pipelines.

Organization',width=60%]

From here, Blue Ocean offers two styles of Pipeline creation, either
"<<github-new-pipeline, single Pipeline>>" or
"<<github-auto-discover, discover all Pipelines>>".

[[github-new-pipeline]]
====== New Pipeline from a Single Repository

Selecting "New Pipeline" allows the user select and create a Pipeline for
a single Repository.

image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/github-new-pipeline.png['Creating a Single
Pipeline',width=60%]

After selecting a repository Blue Ocean will scan all the branches in that Repository
and will create a Pipeline for each branch containing a "Jenkinsfile" in the root folder.
Blue Ocean will then run the Pipeline created for each branch in this process.

If no branches in the selected repository have a "Jenkinsfile",
Blue Ocean will offer to "Create a New Pipeline" for that repository,
taking the user to the
<<pipeline-editor#, Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor>>
to create a new `Jenkinsfile` and add a new Pipeline based on that.

[[github-auto-discover]]
====== Auto-discover Pipelines

Selecting "Auto-discover Pipelines" scans all repositories belonging to the selected owner,
and will create a Pipeline for each branch containing a "Jenkinsfile" in the root folder.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/github-auto-discover.png['Discover All
Pipelines for Owner',width=60%]

This option is useful for adding Pipelines for all the repositories in an organization,
when those repositories already have `Jenkinsfile` entries in them.
Repositories that do not contain `Jenkinsfile` entries are ignored.
To create a new `Jenkinsfile` in a single repository that does not have one, use the
"<<github-new-pipeline, New Pipeline>>" option instead.
