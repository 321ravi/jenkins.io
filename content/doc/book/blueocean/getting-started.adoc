= Getting started with Blue Ocean

This section describes how to get started with Blue Ocean in Jenkins. It
includes instructions for setting up Blue Ocean on your Jenkins instance as well
as how to access the Blue Ocean UI and return to the Jenkins classic UI.


== Installing Blue Ocean

Blue Ocean can be installed using the following methods:

* As a suite of plugins on an
  link:#on-an-existing-jenkins-instance[existing Jenkins instance], or
* As part of link:#as-part-of-jenkins-in-docker[Jenkins in Docker].


=== On an existing Jenkins instance

When Jenkins is installed on most platforms, the
plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean plugin] and all its other dependent plugins (which
form the Blue Ocean "suite of plugins") are not installed by default.

Plugins can be installed on a Jenkins instance by any Jenkins user who has the
*Administer* permission (set through *Matrix-based security*). Jenkins users
with this permission can also configure the permissions of other users on their
system. Read more about this in the
link:/doc/book/managing/security/#authorization[Authorization] section of
link:/doc/book/managing/security[Managing Security].

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins on an existing Jenkins instance, your
Jenkins instance must be running Jenkins 2.7.x or later.

To do this:

. If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins (as a user with the
  *Administer* permission).
. From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI),
  click *Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins* on the left.
. Click the **Available** tab and type `Blue Ocean` into the **Filter** text
  box.
. Click the checkbox in the Install column
. Click either **Install without restart** or **Download now and install after
restart**

For in-depth description on how to install and manage plugins,
refer to the <<../managing/plugins#, Managing Plugins>> section.

The majority of Blue Ocean requires no additional configuration after
installation.  Existing Pipelines and Jobs will continue to work as usual.
However, the first time a <<creating-pipelines#, Pipeline is created or added>>, Blue
Ocean will ask for permissions to access your repositories (either Git or
GitHub) in order to create pipelines based on those repositories.


=== As part of Jenkins in Docker

Read more about this in the link:../../installing/#docker[Docker] section of the
link:../../installing[Installing Jenkins] page.


[[start-blueocean]]
== Starting Blue Ocean

Once a Jenkins environment has Blue Ocean installed, users can start using Blue
Ocean by clicking the **Open Blue Ocean** in the navigation bar of the
Jenkins web UI. Alternatively, users can navigate directly to Blue Ocean at the
`/blue` URL for their Jenkins environment, for example
`http://JENKINS_URL/blue`.

If Pipelines are already present on the current Jenkins instance, this will bring up
the <<dashboard#, Blue Ocean Dashboard>>.

If this is a new Jenkins instance, Blue Ocean will display a box offering to
"<<creating-pipelines#, Create a new pipeline>>."

[[navigation-bar]]
== Navigation bar

Blue Ocean uses a common Navigation bar at the top of most Blue Ocean views.
It includes five buttons:

* *Jenkins* - Navigate to the Dashboard (reload if already viewing it)
* *Pipelines* - Navigate to the Dashboard (do nothing if already viewing it)
* *Administration* - <<../managing#, Manage>> this Jenkins instance (using the Classic UI)
* *Switch to "Classic" UI* - <<switch-to-classic, Switch to the "Classic">>  Jenkins UI
* *Logout* - Logout the current user, return to the Jenkins login page

Views that use the standard navigation bar will add another bar below it with options specific to that view.
Some views replace the common navigation bar with one specifically suited to that view.


[[switch-to-classic]]
== Switching to the "Classic" UI

Blue Ocean may not support some legacy or administrative functions which are
necessary to some users. For those wishing to exit the Blue Ocean user
experience, an "exit" icon is located at the top of most pages in Blue Ocean.
Clicking the exit icon will navigate to the most relevant page in "classic"
which parallels the current page in Blue Ocean.

Some links in Blue Ocean, like **Administration**, will also navigate to the
classic web UI when there is no Blue Ocean equivalent.  In these cases, Blue
Ocean will automatically take the user into the classic web UI as necessary.
