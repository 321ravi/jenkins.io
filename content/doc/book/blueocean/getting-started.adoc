= Getting started with Blue Ocean

This section describes how to get started with Blue Ocean in Jenkins. It
includes instructions for setting up Blue Ocean on your Jenkins instance as well
as how to access the Blue Ocean UI and return to the Jenkins classic UI.


== Installing Blue Ocean

Blue Ocean can be installed using the following methods:

* As a suite of plugins on an
  link:#on-an-existing-jenkins-instance[existing Jenkins instance], or
* As part of link:#as-part-of-jenkins-in-docker[Jenkins in Docker].


=== On an existing Jenkins instance

When Jenkins is installed on most platforms, the
plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean plugin] and all its other dependent plugins (which
form the Blue Ocean "suite of plugins") are not installed by default.

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins on an existing Jenkins instance, your
Jenkins instance must be running Jenkins 2.7.x or later.

Plugins can be installed on a Jenkins instance by any Jenkins user who has the
*Administer* permission (set through *Matrix-based security*). Jenkins users
with this permission can also configure the permissions of other users on their
system. Read more about this in the
link:/doc/book/managing/security/#authorization[Authorization] section of
link:/doc/book/managing/security[Managing Security].

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins to your Jenkins instance:

. If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins (as a user with the
  *Administer* permission).
. From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI),
  click *Manage Jenkins* on the left and then *Manage Plugins* in the center.
. Click the **Available** tab and type `blue ocean` into the **Filter** text
  box, which filters the list of plugins to those whose name and/or description
  contains the words "blue" and "ocean".

. Select the **Blue Ocean** plugin's check box near the top of the the
  **Install** column and then click either the **Download now and install after
  restart** button (recommended) or the **Install without restart** button at
  the end of the page. +
**Notes:**
* There is no need to select the check boxes of the other Blue Ocean plugins in
  this filtered list because the main **Blue Ocean** plugin has other plugin
  dependencies (constituting the Blue Ocean suite of plugins) which will
  automatically be selected and installed when you click one of these "Install"
  buttons.
* If you chose the **Install without restart** button, you may need to restart
  Jenkins in order to gain full Blue Ocean functionality.

Read more about how to install and manage plugins in the
link:../../managing/plugins[Managing Plugins] page.

Blue Ocean requires no additional configuration after installation, and existing
Pipelines projects and other items such as freestyle projects will continue to
work as usual.

Be aware, however, that the first time a
link:../creating-pipelines[Pipeline is created in Blue Ocean] for a specific Git
server (i.e. GitHub, Bitbucket or an ordinary Git server), Blue Ocean prompts
you for credentials to access your repositories on the Git server in order to
create Pipelines based on those repositories. This is required since Blue Ocean
can write `Jenkinsfile`&zwj;s to your repositories.


=== As part of Jenkins in Docker

The Blue Ocean suite of plugins are also bundled as part of a Jenkins Docker
image
(link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[`jenkinsci/blueocean`]),
which is available from the link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub repository].

Read more about running Jenkins and Blue Ocean this way in the
link:../../installing/#docker[Docker] section of the
link:../../installing[Installing Jenkins] page.


== Accessing Blue Ocean

Once a Jenkins environment has Blue Ocean installed, after logging in to the
Jenkins classic UI, you can access the Blue Ocean UI by clicking **Open Blue
Ocean** on the left.

Alternatively, you can access Blue Ocean directly by appending `/blue` to the
end of your Jenkins server's URL - i.e. `http://jenkins-server-url/blue`.

If any Pipeline projects or other items are already present in Jenkins, then
the link:../dashboard[Blue Ocean Dashboard] is displayed.

If this is a new Jenkins instance, Blue Ocean will display a box offering to
"<<creating-pipelines#, Create a new pipeline>>."

[[navigation-bar]]
== Navigation bar

Blue Ocean uses a common Navigation bar at the top of most Blue Ocean views.
It includes five buttons:

* *Jenkins* - Navigate to the Dashboard (reload if already viewing it)
* *Pipelines* - Navigate to the Dashboard (do nothing if already viewing it)
* *Administration* - <<../managing#, Manage>> this Jenkins instance (using the Classic UI)
* *Switch to "Classic" UI* - <<switch-to-classic, Switch to the "Classic">>  Jenkins UI
* *Logout* - Logout the current user, return to the Jenkins login page

Views that use the standard navigation bar will add another bar below it with options specific to that view.
Some views replace the common navigation bar with one specifically suited to that view.


[[switch-to-classic]]
== Switching to the "Classic" UI

Blue Ocean may not support some legacy or administrative functions which are
necessary to some users. For those wishing to exit the Blue Ocean user
experience, an "exit" icon is located at the top of most pages in Blue Ocean.
Clicking the exit icon will navigate to the most relevant page in "classic"
which parallels the current page in Blue Ocean.

Some links in Blue Ocean, like **Administration**, will also navigate to the
classic web UI when there is no Blue Ocean equivalent.  In these cases, Blue
Ocean will automatically take the user into the classic web UI as necessary.
