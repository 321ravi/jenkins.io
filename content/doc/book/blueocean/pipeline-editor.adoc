= Pipeline Editor

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone to get started with
creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It's also great way for existing Jenkins users
to start adopting Pipeline.

The editor allows users to create and edit Declarative Pipelines, add
stages and parallelized tasks that can run at the same time, depending on their
needs. When finished, the editor saves the Pipeline to as ource code repository
as a `Jenkinsfile`.  If the Pipeline needs to be changed again,
Blue Ocean makes it easy to jump back in into the visual editor to modify the
Pipeline at any time.

== Starting the editor

To use the editor a user must first have
<<creating-pipelines, created a pipeline in Blue Ocean>>
or have one or more existing Pipelines already in created in Jenkins.
If editing a existing pipeline, the credentials for that pipeline must allow pushing of
changes to the target repository.

The editor can be launched via:

* Dashboard "New Pipeline" button
* Activity View for Single Run
* Pipeline Run Details

== Limitations

* SCM-based Declarative Pipelines only
* Credentials must have write permission
* Does not have full parity with Declarative Pipeline
* Pipeline re-ordered and comments removed

== Navigation bar

The Pipeline Editor includes the <<getting-started#navigation-bar, standard navigation bar>>
at the top, with a local navigation bar below that.
The local navigation bar includes:

* *Pipeline Name* - This will include the branch depending or how
* *Cancel* - Discard changes made to the pipeline.
* *Save* - Open the <<#save-pipeline-dialog, Save Pipeline Dialog>>.

== Pipeline settings

By default, the right side of editor shows the "Pipeline Settings".
This pane can be accessed by clicking anywhere in the
<<#stage-flow, Stageflow editor>> pane
that is not a Stage or one of the "Add Stage" nodes.

=== Agent

The "Agent" section controls what agent the Pipeline will use.
This is the same as the <<../pipeline/syntax#agent, "agent" directive>>.

=== Environment

The "Environment" sections lets us set environment variables for the Pipeline.
This is the same as the <<../pipeline/syntax#environment, "environment" directive>>.

== Stageflow editor

The left side editor screen contains the Stageflow editor,
used for creating the stages and parallel branches of a Pipeline.

Stages can be added to the Pipeline by clicking the "+" node to the right of an existing stage.
Parallel branches can be added to a stage by clickingthe "+" node below an existing Stage.
Stages and branches can be deleted using the <<#stage-details, context menu in the stage details pane>>.

The Stageflow will display the name of each Stage and branch once it has been set.
Stages that contain incomplete or invalid information will display a warning symbol.
Pipelines can have validation errors while they are being edited,
but cannot be saved until the errors are fixed.

== Stages details

Selecting a node in the Stageflow pane will open the "Stage Details" pane on the right side.
Here we can can change the name of the Stage, delete the Stage,
and add steps to the Stage.

The name of the Stage can be set at the top of the Stage details pane.
The context menu (three dots on the upper right), can be used to delete the current stage.
Clicking "Add step" will display the list of available Steps types with a search bar at the top.
Steps can be deleted using the context <<#step-details, context menu in the step details pane>>.
Adding a step or selecting an existing step will open the <<#step-details, step details pane>>.

== Step details

Selecting a step from the Stage details pane will open the Step details pane.

This pane will differ depending on the step type,
containing whatever fields or controls are needed.
The name of the Step cannot be changed.
The context menu (three dots on the upper right), can be used to delete the current step.
Fields that contain incomplete or invalid information will display a warning symbol.
Pipelines can have validation errors while they are being edited,
but cannot be saved until the errors are fixed.

== Save Pipeline dialog

In order to be run, changes to a Pipeline must be saved in source control
The "Save Pipeline" dialog controls saving of changes to source control.

image:blueocean/editor/save-pipeline.png[Save Pipeline Dialog, role=center]

A helpful description of the changes can be added or left blank.
The dialog also supports saving changes the same branch or entering a new branch to save to.
Clicking on "Save & run" will save any changes to the Pipeline as a new commit,
will start a new Pipeline Run based on those changes, and will navigate to the
<<activity#, Activity View>> for this pipeline.
