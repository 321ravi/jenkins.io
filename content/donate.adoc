We will appreciate any contributions to the Jenkins: code, documentation, etc.

== Why donate?

Historically we have not spent much money on day-to-day operations.
The Jenkins project has no personnel on payroll, all contributions come from individual and company contributors.
Sponsorships cover most of our "big" expenses: most of the infrastructure costs, contributor summits, meetup accounts, swag, etc.
At the same time, your donations help to keep the project going and to facilitate its evolution.

How do we use the donated money?

* Facilitating initiatives within the link:/roadmap/[public Jenkins Roadmap]:
  new features, documentation, user experience improvement, etc.
** Organizing community events
** Running self-funded link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/[outreach and mentorship programs]
** Swag for active Jenkins contributors
* Operating and infrastructure expenses not covered by existing sponsorships
** Certificates and domains for our websites, network transit costs, hardware for self-hosted services
** Cost of SaaS services not covered by sponsorships
* Organizing link:https://www.jenkins.io/events/online-meetup/[Jenkins Online Meetups], link:https://www.jenkins.io/projects/jam/[local meetups] (swag, promotion materials)
* Gifts for link:/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities[reporting security vulnerabilities] (link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/gift/[more info])
* Funding the jep:12[Jenkins Travel Grant Program] to help community members to attend Jenkins related events.
