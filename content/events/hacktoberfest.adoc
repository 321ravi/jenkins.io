is a month long celebration of open source software.
It happens every year in October.
During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a limited edition swag.

We invite everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project, 
regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to 
link:https://jenkins.io/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can write code, write some documentation, 
contribute to link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Internationalization[localization], 
create new link:/artwork[artwork] etc.
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any pull requests in GitHub would qualify.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com[the event website].
2. Join link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[our Gitter channel]
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull-requests!

The Jenkins project is spread across several organizations on GitHub (jenkinsci, jenkins-x, jenkins-infra).
You are welcome contribute to **any** repository in **any** of those organizations, 
however various components in Jenkins have differing review and delivery velocity.

== Featured projects

Jenkins is a big organization, and the contributor experience may vary depending on the repository.
If you are a newcomer contributor, we have prepared a list of projects/components where you will get a warm welcome.
All these projects have newbie-friendly tasks, contributing guidelines, and active maintainers
who have committed to assist contributors and to provide quick turnaround in pull requests.

== FAQ

You can find Hacktoberfest FAQ link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq[here].
Below you can find answer to some Jenkins-specific questions.

=== Q: I am new to Jenkins, how do I start?

If you are new to Jenkins,
you could start by fixing some small and well described issues in the featured projects.
There are lists of such newbie-friendly issues, see the links in the table above.
You can also submit your own issue and propose a fix.

=== Q: I want to work on my own plugin, is it fine?

Yes, it is fine!
Any contributions count, your role in a repository does not matter.
Just make sure you create pull requests instead of direct pushes
(hint: it's a best practice anyway if you have a CI configured for your repository).

=== Q: How to find documentation?

Jenkins project contains lots of materials about contributing to the project.
Here are some links which may help:

* link:/participate/[Participate] - landing page for newcomer contributors
* link:/blog/2017/08/07/intro-to-plugin-development/[Plugin Development Tutorials]
* link:/doc/developer/[Developer Documentation]
* link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[Gitter channel] for Q&A

Projects in the table above also have their own documentation to help newcomers.

=== Q: How do I get reviews?

All projects in the list above are monitored by their maintainers,
and you will likely get a review within few days.
Reviews in other repositories and plugins may take longer.
In the case of delays, ping us in the link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[hacktoberfest] channel in Gitter.
Unmerged pull-requests also count in Hacktoberfest,
so merge delays won't block you from getting prizes.

=== Q: I am stuck. How do I get help?

* For general questions (process and general direction) use our link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[Hacktoberfest Gitter channel]
* You can also use other link:/chat[chats] or
link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists].
Many subprojects also have their own chats, and we encourage using them if you want to reach out to the wider community.

=== Q: Does Jenkins project send special swag?

All participants will get swag from Hacktoberfest organizers if they create at least 5 pull requests.
Jenkins project may also distribute some swag to top contributors,
depending on the budget and contributions.
