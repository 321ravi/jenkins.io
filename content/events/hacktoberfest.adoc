is a month long celebration of open source software.
It happens every year in October.
During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a limited edition swag.

We invite everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project, 
regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to 
link:https://jenkins.io/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can write code, write some documentation, 
contribute to link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Internationalization[localization], 
create new link:/artwork[artwork] etc.
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any pull requests in GitHub would qualify.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com[the event website].
2. Join link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[our Gitter channel]
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull-requests!

The Jenkins project is spread across several organizations on GitHub (jenkinsci, jenkins-x, jenkins-infra).
You are welcome contribute to **any** repository in **any** of those organizations, 
however various components in Jenkins have differing review and delivery velocity.

== Featured projects

Jenkins is a big organization, and the contributor experience may vary depending on the repository.
If you are a newcomer contributor, we have prepared a list of projects/components where you will get a warm welcome.
All these projects have newbie-friendly tasks, contributing guidelines, and active maintainers
who have committed to assist contributors and to provide quick turnaround in pull requests.
