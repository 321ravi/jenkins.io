[[FOSDEM2016-Notes]]
==== Notes

* Who’s coming?
** rtyler (attendance, organizing)
** danielbeck (attendance, organizing)
** kohsuke (attendance, organizing)
** atong (attendance, organizing)
** orrc (attendance)
** fredg (attendance)
* Contributor Summit Notes
** We need a new moniker for the “Summit” series because the current
event plan uses it for another purpose
** Reuse the “Scalability Summit” / “Workflow Summit” format
*** A day of unconference with some broad theme
*** Target attendee: 20-40 people
*** Day divided into a fixed time slots and 1-2 tracks
*** The first few sessions are pre-announced to get the juice flowing
*** The rest of the sessions are decided on the fly by people with
postit notes
** Should be interesting enough for serious users that I expect some
will come just for this.
** Pick a date: Friday vs Monday
*** Meetup.com has a feature that helps us nail this down
*** Needs to be decided soon to let people book travel soon
** Pick a theme
*** User experience?
*** Jenkins as Code?  (pipeline as code, deploy Jenkins via chef/puppet,
Job DSL, …)
*** Jenkins 2.0?
* After-hour events notes
** tyler: Cafe Leroy friday before beer event?
** fred: pre-planned dinner on Saturday night would be ideal
*** alyssa: set up a meetup to get RSVPs to make a reservation in
advance (according to orrc about 15-20 attend. should add ~5 people in
case people bring a friend)
* Stand planning
** Demo Materials
*** monitors
*** at least one dedicated PC (with wireless) for demos
*** canned demos around Jenkins 2.0 work?
**** “new things that people don’t know”
**** fred: maybe a little showreel (workflow, new UI, etc)
**** a demo presentation, or interactive version of the flyer
**** use-case driven points on the website (domain specific destination
pages, e.g. mobile development)
**** eitsch: hi there, if you want to be able to cater to different
 "personas" of jenkins users ... you could prepare some
               sd-cards-images for a raspberry pi and switch around to
         show a running jenkins on monitor at stand
**** eitsch: i definitely liked the stickers more which were more into
the badass type ;) like the ninja and the je[di|nkins] master ... for
the t-shirts you might be able to blend in the upcoming 2016 fosdem logo
(if they are open to letting you use it)

*  
** chris: people are usually coming to the stand asking for help,
stickers and t-shirts
* Schwag
** stickers (few thousand minimum)
** t-shirts always in high demand (more than 30, as many as we can sell)
*** t-shirts maybe also with blended 2016 fosdem logo (need to check if
possible)
** buttons (small round badges) with Jenkins headshot / weather symbols
/ blue balls etc…
*** tyler: buttons for attendees: blue button + happy jenkins, red
button + angry jenkins would be fun
** Jenkins bobble-heads?

*  
** Flyer
*** perhaps this year we create little post-cards with permalinks to
destination pages on the site “want to do mobile: go here”, etc. So
stand visitors would have something tangible to remember where to find
more information
**** more resilient to being out of date by the next time we have a
conference than the flyer
*** fredg: flyer is a bonus not a necessity
*** 18:31 < fredg02> how about a set of "collectible" domain specific
cards (Android, Java, Ruby, PHP, …)
* Other
** Language-spoken type buttons for people manning the stand (e.g. Chris
would have a Scottish flag, English flag and German flag buttons)
